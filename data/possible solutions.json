Fuel pressure should also be tested under load with vehicle in gear or during acceleration. If fuel pressure is below spefications, visually inspect all fuel lines going back to the tank to see if there is a restriction such as a bent fuel line.\nFuel filter may be clogged if it has not been changed for a long time, or the in-tank fuel screen may have become restricted or clogged - check for damage to the fuel tank that could cause the bottom of the tank to press up against the fuel pump inlet.\nFuel pump driver module equipped vehicles are usually operated on a PWM (Pulse width modulated) input signal from the PCM/ECM and a PWM output signal to the fuel pump, in other words they run on a duty cycle - which is a voltage on/off time rather than a constant voltage to regulate the pump speed. The PWM signal can be checked at the driver module using a wiring diagram for reference and a DVOM set to duty cycle with the positive lead on the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground. The duty cycle should vary according to fuel pump demand commanded by the PCM/ECM. Some vehicles such as Ford will double the duty cycle output, so a 30% input will result in a 60% output to the fuel pump. The duty cycle to the fuel pump should reflect this increase. This voltage is usually monitored by the PCM and may set an additional fault code if there is a problem with the fuel pump driver module.\nFuel pressure sensor can be checked using a wiring diagram for reference and DVOM.

{"P0089\n": "\n<strong>Fuel pressure</strong> - Fuel pressure can be checked by using a mechanical gauge attached to the fuel rail. If the fuel pressure is within factory specificaions, there may be a fault with the fuel pressure sensor giving false readings to the PCM/ECM. If a fuel pressure test port is unavailable, the fuel pressure can only be checked using an advanced scan tool or by splicing adapter fittings in between the fuel lines and fuel rail.\n<strong>Fuel pump</strong> - Fuel pump output is determined by the PCM/ECM and may be controlled by an external fuel management computer. The fuel pump may be duty cycle controlled on vehicles with returnless fuel systems. An advanced scan tool may be required to check the output on these type of fuel systems. Test the fuel pump for sufficient power by locating the fuel pump wiring harness. Some vehicles may be inaccessible to easily test the fuel pump wiring connections. Check for battery voltage at the positive terminal of the fuel pump using a digital volt ohm meter set to the volts scale with the positive lead on the power wire and the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the on or run position. The fuel pump power wire may only be supplied voltage during engine cranking or vehicle running condition. Voltage displayed should be close to actual battery voltage.\nIf there is insufficient power, suspect the wiring to the fuel pump and trace it back to determine if there is any excessive resistance in the wiring, loose wires or loose/dirty connections. On return style fuel pumps, the ground can be checked using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on the ground wire and the other lead on a good known ground. Resistance should be very low. On returnless style fuel systems, the trigger wire can be checked using a graphing multimeter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle scale. Typically the duty cycle from the fuel pump computer will be double what the computer commanded duty cycle is commanded by the PCM/ECM. Using the graphing multimeter or oscilloscope, the positive lead will be tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a known good ground, it may be necessary to determine which wire is correct by using a factory wiring diagram. The actual duty cycle should be about double what the PCM/ECM is commanding, if the duty cycle displayed is half of the amount, the settings on the DVOM may need to be changed to accomodate the type of duty cycle being tested.\n<strong>Fuel lines</strong> - Look for physical damage or kinked fuel lines that would cause a restriction in the fuel pump supply or return lines. It may be necessary to remove the fuel filter to determine if the fuel filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, it should flow freely in the direction of flow indicated by an arrow on the fuel filter. Some vehicles are not equipped with fuel filters, and the filter is located on the inlet to the fuel pump itself, it will be necessary to remove the fuel pump module to determine if there is a lot of debris in the tank or if the fuel filter has been crushed or pinched which could also restrict fuel supply to the pump.\n<strong>Regulator</strong> - On vehicles equipped with a return style fuel system, the regulator is usually located on the fuel rail itself. The fuel pressure regulator usually has a vacuum line that will mechanically restrict fuel depending on the amount of vacuum supplied by the engine. Check for damaged or loose vacuum hoses to the regulator. If the vacuum hose has fuel inside of it, the regulator may have an internal leak that would cause a pressure loss. Using a non-damaging clamp, the hose can be pinched off after the fuel pressure regulator - if the fuel pressure is higher with a restriction on the return side of the regulator, the regulator may be at fault. On returnless systems, the fuel pressure regulator may be located inside of the gas tank on the fuel pump module and it may be necessary to replace the fuel pump module as a complete assembly.\n<strong>Fuel pressure sensor </strong>- Test the fuel pressure sensor by removing the connector and checking resistance across the terminals using the DVOM set to ohms scale with the positive and negative lead on either of the connectors. Resistance should be within factory specifications. Check for reference voltage to the fuel pressure sensor with a factory wiring diagram to determine which wire supplies power to the sensor using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive lead on the supply wire and the negative lead on a known good ground. Voltage should be around 5 volts, depending on the vehicle.\nIf voltage is not within specifications, trace the wiring back to determine if there is excessive resistance in the wire supplying power to the sensor. The signal wire can be checked using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive wire tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground with the vehicle on and running. The voltage displayed should match the factory specifications depending on the outside temperature and the internal temperature of the fuel inside the lines. The PCM/ECM converts the voltage to a temperature to determine actual fuel pressure. It may be necessary to check the voltage at the PCM/ECM harness connector as well to determine if there is a difference in voltage. If the voltage at the PCM/ECM is not the same as the voltage displayed at the fuel pressure sensor, there may be excessive resistance in the wiring.\nUnplug the PCM/ECM harness connector and the fuel pressure sensor connector to check for excessive resistance using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on each end of the harnesses. Resistance should be very low, any excessive resistance may be a fault with the wiring or there may be a short to power or ground present. Look for a short to power by removing the PCM/ECM wiring harness connection with the DVOM set to volts scale, with the positive lead on the pin for the fuel pressure signal and the negative lead on a known good ground. If the voltage is the same as reference or higher, there may be a short to power and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine if there is a short. Check for a short to ground by setting the DVOM to the ohms scale with either lead on the signal wire at the PCM/ECM harness connector and the other lead on a good known ground. If there is resistance present, there may be a short to ground and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine where there is a short to ground.\nOther fuel pressure trouble codes include:\n\n<a href=\"/p0087\">P0087 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low\n<a href=\"/p0088\">P0088 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too High\n<a href=\"/p0190\">P0190 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit\n<a href=\"/p0191\">P0191 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance\n<a href=\"/p0192\">P0192 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Low Input\n<a href=\"/p0193\">P0193 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit High Input\n<a href=\"/p0194\">P0194 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\n"}

If it shows more than a few degrees variance (for example, if it indicates a temperature extreme like negative 40 deg. or 300 deg. then obviously there's a problem) unplug the IAT and do a resistance test across the two terminals.\nEach sensor will have different resistances so you'll have to get that info from a repair manual. If the resistance of the IAT sensor isn't within specs, replace the sensor. There should be some resistance, so if it measures infinite resistance, replace the sensor.\nHaving said that, here is a little more diagnostic info if that doesn't take care of it:\n1. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the high extreme, like 300 deg. (which obviously is inaccurate), disconnect the IAT sensor. If the reading now shows the lowest extreme (-50 or so), then replace the IAT sensor. However, if when unplugging the IAT, the reading doesn't change then turn off the ignition and disconnect the PCM connector. Use a voltmeter to check for continuity between a good ground and the signal wire to the IAT. If there is continuity, then repair short to ground on the signal wire. If there is not continuity, then the PCM may have a problem\n2. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the low extreme, again disconnect the IAT connector. Check that there is 5 Volts on the signal and the other is grounded.\na. If you have 5 volts present and a good ground, jumper the two terminals together. Now the reading on the scanner should be at the high extreme. If it is, replace the IAT sensor. But if it stays low even after you jumper the two wires together, then there may be an open in the wiring harness or a problem with the PCM.\nb. If you don't have 5 Volts present, then check for reference voltage back at the PCM connector.

If they are OK, try raising and lowering the temperature of the IAT sensor artificially. Do this by removing the IAT and putting it in a freezer and then applying heat with a heat gun (be careful not to apply too much heat to the IAT with the heat gun or it'll melt the sensor). Watch the resistance change using an ohmmeter attached to each terminal. It should vary smoothly with no sudden jumps. If the reading jumps suddenly, then repace the IAT sensor.\nHowever if the freeze frame reading was at the highest extreme (above 250 deg.

If you are at a higher altitude, it should decrease about half a volt or so for each 1,000 ft. of altitude (this will vary from model to model) Or if you have a separate MAF (Mass air flow) sensor on your vehicle, they are usually equipped with a Barometric pressure reading. If so, the Baro reading should match the MAP reading (they both measure ambient air pressure). If they're roughly equal, then, check for Freeze Frame data of the MAP sensor (if available).\nNOTE: Freeze Frame data is the PCM recording a fault when it happens. It captures the readings of the various PIDS (parameter identifiers)available to troubleshoot what happened. It's like a recording of the problem as it happened. At idle a typical MAP sensor Voltage reading should be about a volt, and at WOT (wide open throttle) it should approach 4.5 to 5 Volts. As for the TPS, at idle, the voltage reading is about 1 Volt or less. As the throttle is opened the reading will increase to 4.5 Volts at WOT. Do the two readings make sense? For example, if the TPS reading on Freeze Frame data shows 2.5 Volts (indicating partial throttle) does the MAP sensor indicate a reading that isn't at either extreme? Using the Freeze Frame data (if available) compare the MAP reading to the TPS when the problem occurred. This can help you identify what happened\n If you have no access to Freeze Frame data then check if the MAP sensor voltage changes when you apply vacuum to it. You can do this by mouth or a vacuum pump. The voltage should increase as you apply vacuum. If the reading doesn't change as you apply vacuum, make sure there are no obstructions in the hose to the sensor.

If there is power and ground to the heater element check that the sensor ground is present. If it is, connect a jumper wire between the sensor ground and signal wire. Now the 2/2 o2 sensor reading should be low. If so, replace the Bank 2 position 2 o2 sensor. If, after connecting the jumper wire, the o2 sensor reading still remains \"stuck\", check for wiring problems, harness contacting exhaust components, or broken connectors. Repair as necessary. Then recheck. If you can find no wiring problems and the o2 sensor reading on the scan tool doesn't change after installing the jumper wire, recheck at the PCM connector. It may be necessary to clip the signal wire near the PCM in a location that will be easy to repair. If it now shows a low voltage reading, then you know beyond a doubt that there is a wiring problem. At this point clipping the offending wire out of the harness and running a new one may be your best bet. But If it still shows no change, the PCM may be at fault.\n"}

If it does after a period of elevated idle, check under the vehicle for rusty exhaust components or holes in the exhaust near the O2 sensor(s). Repair as necessary.

{"P0163\n": "\nIt's always good to start with checking for air leaks in the exhaust manifold and in the exhaust pipes. Fix these first. With KOER (Key on engine running) use a scan tool or a voltmeter check the O2 sensor signal voltage with engine warm. You may have to increase the RPM to a fast idle to check the voltage of the bank 2,3 sensor. If it's voltage is stuck low (less than 0.5 volts) and you don't have any other O2 sensor codes present in the PCM, then the sensor is probably bad. If the voltage isn't stuck low and the O2 sensor seems to be operating fine, it's likely sticking low intermittently. This often turns out to be the sensor. In either case, replacing the sensor can be an effective way to diagnose the problem. But it can also be an expensive diagnostic tool, especially if it turns out to be a wiring issue, instead of a sensor.\nSo, if you're interested in knowing for sure what the problem is before spending unnecessarily, then perform the following: 1. Turn off the engine and unplug the 2,3 O2 sensor connector. Inspect for corrosion, etc. Repair as necessary. Make sure that there is battery voltage present and ground present for the O2 sensor heater. If there isn't, then diagnose that first then retest. The O2 sensor depends on the heater to warm it up so it can start working quicker. If the heater element is bad or there isn't the proper voltage supplying it, the sensor may set this code. Usually heater problems have codes associated with them, too. If you find there is no battery voltage feeding the O2 sensor use the associated code to diagnose that. If you find the heater element bad, replace the sensor. If the heater element checks out then, using a jumper wire, supply a chassis ground to the O2 sensor connector (PCM side) ground circuit. Now observe the scan tool bank 2,3 O2 sensor reading. If it is now at about a half a volt then replace the O2 sensor.\nIf, after supplying a ground to the unplugged PCM side of the O2 sensor connector, the voltage reading doesn't change then check the harness for short to ground. Check for harness making contact with exhaust components. Check pins for damage, and for moisture. Repair as necessary. If you can find no harness problems, then the PCM may be at fault.\n"}

Also check that the heater element is being supplied good battery voltage. No heater operation can cause a sluggish sensor.\nIf the grounds are good and the battery voltage is present, then jumper the sensor's signal wire to the sensor's ground wire. Now the scan tool should read low or near zero volts. If it does, the wiring is good. Replace the bank 2/3 O2 sensor. If jumpering the signal wire to the ground doesn't lower the voltage, then check the O2 sensor wiring harness. Make sure there is no contact with hot exhaust components. Ensure good wiring harness connections. If the wiring checks out, then reperform the previous wiring harness checks at the PCM connector.\nIf now the 2/3 O2 sensor reading drops, then there is a wiring problem that isn't visible.

Check for presence of battery voltage (12 Volts) at one wire of each injector connector. If all are missing, check for continuity to ground on the voltage circuit by using a test light connected to positive battery and probe each voltage feed. If it lights up, then there is a short to ground on the voltage feed causing a short. Get a wiring diagram and repair the short on the voltage feed and reestablish proper battery voltage. (Don't forget to check for a blown fuse and replace as necessary). NOTE: It's possible for one injector to short out the whole battery voltage feed to all the injectors. So if you have lost voltage to all the injectors, replace the blown fuse and plug each injector in, one by one. If the fuse blows, the last injector you plugged in is shorted. Replace it and retest. If only one or two battery feeds are missing, then it's more likely to be a shorted battery voltage feed in the individual injector wiring harness. Inspect and repair as necessary.\n2. If you have battery voltage fed to each injector harness, then the next step is to get a noid light to check for injector driver operation. A noid light will insert into the injector harness in place of the fuel injector and flash rapidly when the injector driver operates. Check each fuel injector connector. If the noid light flashes rapidly then suspect the injector. Ohm each fuel injector if you have a resistance specification. If the injector is open or the resistance is higher or lower than the spec, replace the fuel injector. If the injector tests out, the problem is likely an intermittent wiring problem. (Remember that a fuel injector can work properly when cold but go open when hot, or vice versa. So it's best to do these checks when the problem is occurring). Check the wiring harness for any chafing, or the injector connector for loose pins or a broken lock. Repair as necessary and retest. Now, if the noid light doesn't flash, then there's a problem with the driver or the driver circuit. Unplug the PCM connector and ohm the fuel injector driver circuits. Any resistance means there's a problem. Infinite resistance points to an open in the circuit. Find it and repair it, then retest.
