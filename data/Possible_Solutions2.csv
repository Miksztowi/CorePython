","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nFactory turbocharger boost pressure usually ranges between nine and fourteen pounds but check manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications for your vehicle. Test boost pressure to make sure that it is sufficient. If boost pressure is low, internal turbocharger repair or turbocharger replacement may be necessary. Also check turbo hoses and exhaust components for leakage.\nThere are two basic designs of turbo boost control valves. In the first design, the valve is actuated using engine vacuum. An electronically controlled vacuum control valve provides vacuum to open the boost control valve, which is closed after vacuum is restricted. Typically, the vacuum control valve (or solenoid) is supplied with battery voltage and the PCM (or boost controller) provides a ground signal when applicable. In this type of system, engine vacuum must be checked prior to testing system electrical circuitry, components, and connectors. You may quick check the boost control valve using a hand-held vacuum pump. Simply apply vacuum directly to the valve and check operation.\nThe other turbo boost pressure control valve design utilizes an electronic valve. The valve receives a voltage signal from the PCM (or boost controller) when applicable. The voltage signal causes the valve to open and close proportionally as required to maintain optimum boost pressure. \n\nProfessional technicians report that the boost control valve is often condemned in error, when the boost pressure sensor is the defective part\n Using a digital volt/ohmmeter, test system circuit voltage and continuity to ensure that it is within manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications.

This serves two purposes; if the code fails to reset, you know that it is intermittent and, if your vehicle places the boost pressure bypass valve in the wide-open position when this type of code is stored, it will allow the system to return to a normal operating mode prior to further testing. \n\n Be sure to disconnect system components and controllers prior to testing circuit continuity (with a DVOM) to prevent damage\n I have had several experiences in which the boost control valve was condemned in error, when the boost pressure sensor was actually the defective part\nI normally use a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM) to test system circuit voltage and continuity to ensure that it is within manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications.

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nPursuant to maintaining an acceptable degree of turbo/supercharger boost pressure, the boost pressure bypass control valve is designed to open and close to a calculated degree (via an electrical signal from the PCM). The desired position of the valve is one which will afford maximum engine performance and efficiency, while avoiding potentially harmful (to the engine) boost levels.\nWhen diagnosing a P0039 turbo/supercharger bypass valve control circuit range/performance code, I would likely begin with an inspection of all wiring and vacuum hoses related to the turbo/supercharger and boost control system. I would also include an inspection of the battery, battery cables, and battery cable ends. \nProceed by retrieving and making note of all stored trouble codes and freeze-frame data (if available). Clear all stored diagnostic trouble codes from the system using a code reader or scanner. You may determine that the code is intermittent if it fails to reset. Intermittent codes can be even more difficult to diagnose. When this type of code is stored, some OBD-II systems will put the boost pressure bypass valve in the wide-open position. By clearing the stored codes, you will allow the boost pressure bypass valve system to return to a normal mode before you continue testing. \n\n A scanner (or code reader), digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a system wiring diagram or manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s service manual (with diagnostic flow charts) will prove necessary as well\n Take care to disconnect system controllers and components from the circuit prior to testing resistance/continuity with a DVOM \n The boost control valve is often condemned in error when the boost pressure sensor is actually faulty \n To prevent misdiagnosis, which could cause unnecessary replacement of parts, perform exhaustive testing of individual circuits and components related to this code \n I utilize a (DVOM) for testing. This will allow you to determine if system circuit voltage and resistance levels are within manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications. \n\n'"

","b""\nLike an auto technician, start with the most common problems. You will need a volt/ohmmeter, wire-piercing probe for the meter, a can of carburetor cleaner and a can of intake cleaner. Repair any problems as they are found and start the vehicle to determine if the problem is corrected -- if not continue the procedures. \nWith the engine off, open the hood and check the air cleaner element. \nLook for any loose clamps or leaks in the piping from the mass airflow sensor to the throttle body. \nInspect all the vacuum lines on the intake manifold for obstructions, cracks or looseness which could cause loss of vacuum. \nDisconnect each of the sensors and check the connector for corrosion and pushed out or bent pins. \nStart the engine and use the carburetor cleaner to find any leaks in the intake manifold. A short shot of carburetor cleaner over a leak will change the engine rpm noticeably. Hold the can at arms length to keep the spray from contacting your eyes lest you learn the lesson much like picking up a cat by the tail. You won't forget next time. Spray all connection points on the manifold for leaks. \nTake the clamp loose on the pipe connecting the mass airflow to the throttle body. Look in the throttle body to see if it's coated with coke -- a black greasy looking substance. If it is, pinch the tube from the intake cleaner bottle between the pipe and the throttle body. Push the pipe on the throttle body and start the engine. Begin the spray until the can is gone. Remove it and reconnect the pipe to the throttle body. \nTest the mass airflow sensor. Pull the connector off the sensor. Turn the ignition on with the engine off. There are three wires, 12 volt power, sensor ground and signal (usually yellow.) use the red voltmeter lead to probe the connector for 12 volts. Keep the black lead on ground. No voltage is a ignition or wiring problem. Install the connector and check the sensor ground. It must be under 100 mv. If the sensor has 12 volts and out of range on the ground, replace the sensor. This is a basic test. If it passes yet when finished with all tests and the problem still persists, the mass airflow may still be bad. Have it checked on a graphing computer such as the Tech II. \nCheck the operation of the throttle position sensor. Make sure it is seated properly and the bolts are tight. It is a three-wire connector -- dark blue for the signal, grey for the 5 volt reference voltage and a black or orange for the PCM negative wire.\n- Connect the voltmeter red lead to the blue signal wire and the black voltmeter lead to a ground. Turn the key on with the engine off. If the sensor is good it will have less than 1 volt with the throttle closed. As the throttle is advanced the voltage will rise smoothly to approximately 4 volts with no drop outs or glitches. \nCheck the MAP sensor. Turn the key on and backprobe the power reference wire with the red voltmeter lead and the black to ground. With the key on and engine off it must have 4.5 to 5 volts. Start the engine. It must have 0.5 to 1.5 volts depending on altitude and temperature. Raise the engine rpm. The voltage must react to the throttle opening by dropping and rising again. If not replace it. \n \n\n \n"""

This sensor is found around the intake manifold and the throttle body. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. Inspect the vacuum passage from the intake manifold to the MAP sensor. Insure that it is free from debris and full manifold vacuum is getting to it (put your finger over the opening; should suck it closed!).\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0069 code does return, we will need to test the MAP sensor and its associated circuits. With Key On Engine Off, locate the MAP sensor PID on your scan tool if available. At sea level, it should read 0&quot; vacuum, approx. 100 kilopascals or 29.92 inches of mercury. These would all indicate atmospheric pressure KOEO. Once you start the engine, you should notice the readings change, depending upon the condition of the engine and upon how much you are pushing in on the throttle (around 20 inches of vacuum @ idle to 2-5 inches @ wide open throttle). \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0069, this would most likely indicate a failed MAP sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the MAP sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n \n\n \n'"

Determine the temperature of the sensor (what is the temperature outside) to the resistance on the chart. This is the resistance in ohms that your DVOM should be displaying. Either 0 ohms or infinite resistance (usually indicated by the letters OL) indicates a failed sensor.\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0070 code does return, we will need to test the AAT sensor and its associated circuits. Typically, there are 2 wires at the AAT sensor. With the ignition switch off, disconnect the harness going to the AAT sensor. Turn the ignition switch on. With a scan tool accessing PCM data (provided that is the module receiving the AAT sensor input; the module receiving the AAT sensor input may be the Air Conditioning control module, Generic Electronic Module or some other module towards the front of the vehicle that can send the AAT sensor data over a bus network), read the AAT sensor temperature or voltage. It should read 5 volts or something other than ambient air temperature (very low temperature) in degrees. Next, turn the ignition switch off, connect a jumper wire across the two terminals inside the harness connector going to the AAT sensor, then turn the ignition switch on. It should read close to 0 volts or something other than ambient air temperature (very high temperature) in degrees. If there is no 5 volts to the sensor, or if you see no change, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor, or possibly a bad PCM. \nReconnect the sensor and wiggle the connector while monitoring the voltage or degrees from the AAT sensor. If a change in either is detected while wiggling wires, this indicates intermittent connection. Look at where the wires are routed and note any point where they could be touching/rubbing up against body panels or the frame. \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0070, this would most likely indicate a failed AAT sensor, although a failed control module could not be ruled out until the AAT sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n \n\n \n'"

","b'\nIf vehicle is equipped with a fuel pressure test port at the fuel rail or line, check fuel pressure using a mechanical pressure gauge to determine if it is within specifications. Fuel pressure should also be tested under load with vehicle in gear or during acceleration. If fuel pressure is below spefications, visually inspect all fuel lines going back to the tank to see if there is a restriction such as a bent fuel line.\nFuel filter may be clogged if it has not been changed for a long time, or the in-tank fuel screen may have become restricted or clogged - check for damage to the fuel tank that could cause the bottom of the tank to press up against the fuel pump inlet.\nFuel pump driver module equipped vehicles are usually operated on a PWM (Pulse width modulated) input signal from the PCM/ECM and a PWM output signal to the fuel pump, in other words they run on a duty cycle - which is a voltage on/off time rather than a constant voltage to regulate the pump speed. The PWM signal can be checked at the driver module using a wiring diagram for reference and a DVOM set to duty cycle with the positive lead on the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground. The duty cycle should vary according to fuel pump demand commanded by the PCM/ECM. Some vehicles such as Ford will double the duty cycle output, so a 30% input will result in a 60% output to the fuel pump. The duty cycle to the fuel pump should reflect this increase. This voltage is usually monitored by the PCM and may set an additional fault code if there is a problem with the fuel pump driver module.\nFuel pressure sensor can be checked using a wiring diagram for reference and DVOM. Typically there is a reference voltage power or ground wire that is monitored by the PCM. A problem with the power or ground wire would typically set a different code such as P0191 - Fuel rail pressure sensor circuit range/performance. Excessive resistance in the sensor or wiring leads may lead to an incorrect reading. Using the DVOM set to ohms scale, check the resistance of the pressure sensor by unplugging the sensor and attaching the positive and negative leads to the sensor connector. If the resistance is higher than specifications, replace the sensor. The wiring can be tested using the DVOM set to ohms as well by disconnecting the sensor and the PCM and checking for excessive resistance between the two terminal ends of the wiring harnesses with the positive lead of the DVOM on one end and the negative lead on the other end of the same wire.\n'"

","b'\nFuel pressure - Fuel pressure can be checked by using a mechanical gauge attached to the fuel rail. If the fuel pressure is within factory specificaions, there may be a fault with the fuel pressure sensor giving false readings to the PCM/ECM. If a fuel pressure test port is unavailable, the fuel pressure can only be checked using an advanced scan tool or by splicing adapter fittings in between the fuel lines and fuel rail.\nFuel pump - Fuel pump output is determined by the PCM/ECM and may be controlled by an external fuel management computer. The fuel pump may be duty cycle controlled on vehicles with returnless fuel systems. An advanced scan tool may be required to check the output on these type of fuel systems. Test the fuel pump for sufficient power by locating the fuel pump wiring harness. Some vehicles may be inaccessible to easily test the fuel pump wiring connections. Check for battery voltage at the positive terminal of the fuel pump using a digital volt ohm meter set to the volts scale with the positive lead on the power wire and the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the on or run position. The fuel pump power wire may only be supplied voltage during engine cranking or vehicle running condition. Voltage displayed should be close to actual battery voltage.\nIf there is insufficient power, suspect the wiring to the fuel pump and trace it back to determine if there is any excessive resistance in the wiring, loose wires or loose/dirty connections. On return style fuel pumps, the ground can be checked using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on the ground wire and the other lead on a good known ground. Resistance should be very low. On returnless style fuel systems, the trigger wire can be checked using a graphing multimeter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle scale. Typically the duty cycle from the fuel pump computer will be double what the computer commanded duty cycle is commanded by the PCM/ECM. Using the graphing multimeter or oscilloscope, the positive lead will be tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a known good ground, it may be necessary to determine which wire is correct by using a factory wiring diagram. The actual duty cycle should be about double what the PCM/ECM is commanding, if the duty cycle displayed is half of the amount, the settings on the DVOM may need to be changed to accomodate the type of duty cycle being tested.\nFuel lines - Look for physical damage or kinked fuel lines that would cause a restriction in the fuel pump supply or return lines. It may be necessary to remove the fuel filter to determine if the fuel filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, it should flow freely in the direction of flow indicated by an arrow on the fuel filter. Some vehicles are not equipped with fuel filters, and the filter is located on the inlet to the fuel pump itself, it will be necessary to remove the fuel pump module to determine if there is a lot of debris in the tank or if the fuel filter has been crushed or pinched which could also restrict fuel supply to the pump.\nRegulator - On vehicles equipped with a return style fuel system, the regulator is usually located on the fuel rail itself. The fuel pressure regulator usually has a vacuum line that will mechanically restrict fuel depending on the amount of vacuum supplied by the engine. Check for damaged or loose vacuum hoses to the regulator. If the vacuum hose has fuel inside of it, the regulator may have an internal leak that would cause a pressure loss. Using a non-damaging clamp, the hose can be pinched off after the fuel pressure regulator - if the fuel pressure is higher with a restriction on the return side of the regulator, the regulator may be at fault. On returnless systems, the fuel pressure regulator may be located inside of the gas tank on the fuel pump module and it may be necessary to replace the fuel pump module as a complete assembly.\nFuel pressure sensor - Test the fuel pressure sensor by removing the connector and checking resistance across the terminals using the DVOM set to ohms scale with the positive and negative lead on either of the connectors. Resistance should be within factory specifications. Check for reference voltage to the fuel pressure sensor with a factory wiring diagram to determine which wire supplies power to the sensor using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive lead on the supply wire and the negative lead on a known good ground. Voltage should be around 5 volts, depending on the vehicle.\nIf voltage is not within specifications, trace the wiring back to determine if there is excessive resistance in the wire supplying power to the sensor. The signal wire can be checked using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive wire tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground with the vehicle on and running. The voltage displayed should match the factory specifications depending on the outside temperature and the internal temperature of the fuel inside the lines. The PCM/ECM converts the voltage to a temperature to determine actual fuel pressure. It may be necessary to check the voltage at the PCM/ECM harness connector as well to determine if there is a difference in voltage. If the voltage at the PCM/ECM is not the same as the voltage displayed at the fuel pressure sensor, there may be excessive resistance in the wiring.\nUnplug the PCM/ECM harness connector and the fuel pressure sensor connector to check for excessive resistance using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on each end of the harnesses. Resistance should be very low, any excessive resistance may be a fault with the wiring or there may be a short to power or ground present. Look for a short to power by removing the PCM/ECM wiring harness connection with the DVOM set to volts scale, with the positive lead on the pin for the fuel pressure signal and the negative lead on a known good ground. If the voltage is the same as reference or higher, there may be a short to power and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine if there is a short. Check for a short to ground by setting the DVOM to the ohms scale with either lead on the signal wire at the PCM/ECM harness connector and the other lead on a good known ground. If there is resistance present, there may be a short to ground and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine where there is a short to ground.\nOther fuel pressure trouble codes include:\n\nP0087 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low\nP0088 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too High\nP0190 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit\nP0191 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance\nP0192 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Low Input\nP0193 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit High Input\nP0194 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\n'"

If the oil level has risen, smell the oil. If it is heavily contaminated by fuel, an injector most likely failed in the open position. Do not start the engine again until the oil and filter is changed.\nLook under the hood for leaks. Start at the injector pump and follow the fuel lines to the fuel injector rail. Look at the injectors for signs of leaks.\nPull the electrical connector off the fuel pressure sensor and look for fuel in the connector. A failed sensor will allow fuel up through the sensor into the connector.\nCheck when you last changed the fuel filter. A plugged fuel filter will drop the volume enough to set the code.\nCheck all electrical connectors on the sensors and wiring harness to the injectors for missing insulation, corrosion or loose connections. If no obvious leaks have been found, go online and look up the TSBs (technical service bulletins) for your year and make vehicle. Diesels have no lack of problems as the TSBs will indicate. \n\nLook for the code and associated repair procedures and probable causes. Chevy and Dodge reads like a book.

","b""\nFirst visually check that the IAT is in place and hasn't been dislodged. As a quick check of the IAT, use a scan tool &amp; check for IAT reading with KOEO (Key on engine off). If the engine is cold, the IAT reading should be the same as the CTS (Coolant temperature sensor) reading. If it shows more than a few degrees variance (for example, if it indicates a temperature extreme like negative 40 deg. or 300 deg. then obviously there's a problem) unplug the IAT and do a resistance test across the two terminals.\nEach sensor will have different resistances so you'll have to get that info from a repair manual. If the resistance of the IAT sensor isn't within specs, replace the sensor. There should be some resistance, so if it measures infinite resistance, replace the sensor.\nHaving said that, here is a little more diagnostic info if that doesn't take care of it:\n1. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the high extreme, like 300 deg. (which obviously is inaccurate), disconnect the IAT sensor. If the reading now shows the lowest extreme (-50 or so), then replace the IAT sensor. However, if when unplugging the IAT, the reading doesn't change then turn off the ignition and disconnect the PCM connector. Use a voltmeter to check for continuity between a good ground and the signal wire to the IAT. If there is continuity, then repair short to ground on the signal wire. If there is not continuity, then the PCM may have a problem\n2. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the low extreme, again disconnect the IAT connector. Check that there is 5 Volts on the signal and the other is grounded.\na. If you have 5 volts present and a good ground, jumper the two terminals together. Now the reading on the scanner should be at the high extreme. If it is, replace the IAT sensor. But if it stays low even after you jumper the two wires together, then there may be an open in the wiring harness or a problem with the PCM.\nb. If you don't have 5 Volts present, then check for reference voltage back at the PCM connector. If it's present there but not at the IAT sensor, repair the open in the signal wire. \nOther IAT sensor and circuit related trouble codes: P0127\n"""

","b'\nIf there are other IAT codes present, diagnose them first. If not, then, using a scan tool verify the IAT voltage with KOEO (Key on engine off).\nIf, on a cold engine it reads the same as the P0110. If your scan tool has a freeze frame failure records feature, use it to see what the IAT reading was at the time of the failure. If the reading was at negative 30 or so degrees F (indicating it was at the extreme coldest reading), then there was an intermittent high resistance reading on the IAT signal circuit.\nCheck for an open ground on the ground circuit and signal circuit. If they are OK, try raising and lowering the temperature of the IAT sensor artificially. Do this by removing the IAT and putting it in a freezer and then applying heat with a heat gun (be careful not to apply too much heat to the IAT with the heat gun or it\'ll melt the sensor). Watch the resistance change using an ohmmeter attached to each terminal. It should vary smoothly with no sudden jumps. If the reading jumps suddenly, then repace the IAT sensor.\nHowever if the freeze frame reading was at the highest extreme (above 250 deg. F) then there was an intermittent low resistance on the signal circuit. Check for a short to ground on the signal circuit. If it appears OK, then do the above artificial heat test and replace the IAT as necessary. If the problem can\'t be duplicated, use a voltmeter to watch the signal voltage as you ""wiggle"" test the wiring harness. Watch for a sudden change in voltage indicating a short or open. Replace IAT as necessary.\nThis is a pretty simple code and it only really looks for extremely short changes that are relatively high in voltage.

Use the infrared thermometer to make sure that the IAT reading (on the scanner) correctly reflects actual intake air temperature.\nIf it is incorrect, consult your vehicle information source for IAT sensor testing recommendations. Use the DVOM to test the sensor and compare your findings with vehicle specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply. \nIf the sensor passes the resistance test, check for a sensor reference voltage and a ground. If either one of these are not present repair the open or shorted circuit and retest the system. If system reference and ground signals are present, obtain an IAT sensor voltage to temperature chart from your vehicle information source and use the DVOM to test sensor output voltage. Compare the voltage with the voltage to temperature chart and replace the sensor if actual findings vary from maximum recommended tolerances.\nIf actual IAT input voltage is within specifications, disconnect the electrical connector/s from all related controllers and use the DVOM to test resistance and continuity on all system circuits. Repair or replace circuits that prove to be open or shorted and retest the system.\nIf the IAT sensor and all system circuits are within recommended specifications, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nBy far, the most common cause of a P0099 being stored is a disconnected #2 IAT sensor connector. When the air filter is checked or replaced, the IAT sensor is often left disconnected. If your vehicle has recently been service, and a code P0099 is suddenly stored, suspect that the IAT sensor has simply been left unplugged.\n\nRelated IAT sensor and circuit trouble codes: P0127\n \n\n \n'"

","b""\nUsing a scanner or code reader, turn the ignition on and engine OFF; what does the MAP sensor voltage read? It should be about 4 Volts for sea level. If you are at a higher altitude, it should decrease about half a volt or so for each 1,000 ft. of altitude (this will vary from model to model) Or if you have a separate MAF (Mass air flow) sensor on your vehicle, they are usually equipped with a Barometric pressure reading. If so, the Baro reading should match the MAP reading (they both measure ambient air pressure). If they're roughly equal, then, check for Freeze Frame data of the MAP sensor (if available).\nNOTE: Freeze Frame data is the PCM recording a fault when it happens. It captures the readings of the various PIDS (parameter identifiers)available to troubleshoot what happened. It's like a recording of the problem as it happened. At idle a typical MAP sensor Voltage reading should be about a volt, and at WOT (wide open throttle) it should approach 4.5 to 5 Volts. As for the TPS, at idle, the voltage reading is about 1 Volt or less. As the throttle is opened the reading will increase to 4.5 Volts at WOT. Do the two readings make sense? For example, if the TPS reading on Freeze Frame data shows 2.5 Volts (indicating partial throttle) does the MAP sensor indicate a reading that isn't at either extreme? Using the Freeze Frame data (if available) compare the MAP reading to the TPS when the problem occurred. This can help you identify what happened\n If you have no access to Freeze Frame data then check if the MAP sensor voltage changes when you apply vacuum to it. You can do this by mouth or a vacuum pump. The voltage should increase as you apply vacuum. If the reading doesn't change as you apply vacuum, make sure there are no obstructions in the hose to the sensor. If the hose is clear, the MAP sensor is usually bad, but it doesn't rule out the following from causing the problem: Does the MAP sensor appear to be stuck at less than .5 Volts? Then:\nNOTE: This code shouldn't set if the MAP is stuck at extremely low voltage, however, I'm adding it in because there's no way to know for certain for which vehicles a low voltage condition may set a P0105.\n\nInspect the wiring harness and MAP sensor connector. Repair any damage\nUnplug the MAP sensor connector. Also, at the PCM connector, remove the MAP sensor signal wire and check for continuity to the MAP sensor connector. If there is infinite resistance, then repair open in MAP signal circuit. If the signal wire has continuity to the MAP sensor connector, then check for 5 volt reference voltage to the connector and a good ground. If both are present, then re-install all removed wiring and replace the MAP sensor.\n\nDoes the MAP sensor appear to be stuck at full 4.5 voltage? Then:\n\nInspect the wiring harness for damage.

","b'\nA good way to diagnose if the MAP sensor is to blame would be to compare the KOEO (key on engine off) MAP sensor reading on a scan tool with the Barometric pressure reading.

Otherwise, start the engine and observe the MAP reading at idle. It should normally be about 1.5 volts (varies according to altitude).\na. If it is, the problem is likely intermittent. Check all the vacuum hoses for damage and replace as necessary. You can also try wiggle testing the harness and connector to reproduce the problem.<br>\nb. If the scan tool MAP reading is more than 4.5 volts, check the actual engine vacuum reading with the engine running. If it is less than 15 or 16 in.

Corroded connector faces and damaged wiring must be rectified before proceeding with the diagnostic process.\nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Make a note of this information. It may prove useful in the event that the P0109 is an intermittent code. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle.\nAn engine vacuum test can help to ensure that the engine is making sufficient vacuum. Consult your vehicle information source for minimum engine vacuum specifications. Poorly running engines will not produce sufficient vacuum for the MAP sensor. Ignition misfire codes should be diagnosed and repaired before attempting to diagnose a P0109. Clogged catalytic converters, restricted mufflers, and low fuel pressure may also contribute to insufficient engine vacuum.\nIf a P0109 is immediately reset, and all circuits and connectors appear to be in order, continue testing at the MAP sensor. Follow manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations for testing the MAP sensor. Use the DVOM to test resistance of the MAP sensor.

","b""\nFirst visually check that the IAT is in place and hasn't been dislodged. As a quick check of the IAT, use a scan tool &amp; check for IAT reading with KOEO (Key on engine off). If the engine is cold, the IAT reading should be the same as the CTS (Coolant temperature sensor) reading. If it shows more than a few degrees variance (for example, if it indicates a temperature extreme like negative 40 deg. or 300 deg. then obviously there's a problem) unplug the IAT and do a resistance test across the two terminals.\nEach sensor will have different resistances so you'll have to get that info from a repair manual. If the resistance of the IAT sensor isn't within specs, replace the sensor. There should be some resistance, so if it measures infinite resistance, replace the sensor.\nHaving said that, here is a little more diagnostic info if that doesn't take care of it:\n1. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the high extreme, like 300 deg. (which obviously is inaccurate), disconnect the IAT sensor. If the reading now shows the lowest extreme (-50 or so), then replace the IAT sensor. However, if when unplugging the IAT, the reading doesn't change then turn off the ignition and disconnect the PCM connector. Use a voltmeter to check for continuity between a good ground and the signal wire to the IAT. If there is continuity, then repair short to ground on the signal wire. If there is not continuity, then the PCM may have a problem\n2. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the low extreme, again disconnect the IAT connector. Check that there is 5 Volts on the signal and the other is grounded.\na. If you have 5 volts present and a good ground, jumper the two terminals together. Now the reading on the scanner should be at the high extreme. If it is, replace the IAT sensor. But if it stays low even after you jumper the two wires together, then there may be an open in the wiring harness or a problem with the PCM.\nb. If you don't have 5 Volts present, then check for reference voltage back at the PCM connector.

If not, then, using a scan tool verify the IAT voltage with KOEO (Key on engine off).\nIf, on a cold engine it reads the same as the P0110. If your scan tool has a freeze frame failure records feature, use it to see what the IAT reading was at the time of the failure. If the reading was at negative 30 or so degrees F (indicating it was at the extreme coldest reading), then there was an intermittent high resistance reading on the IAT signal circuit.\nCheck for an open ground on the ground circuit and signal circuit. If they are OK, try raising and lowering the temperature of the IAT sensor artificially. Do this by removing the IAT and putting it in a freezer and then applying heat with a heat gun (be careful not to apply too much heat to the IAT with the heat gun or it\'ll melt the sensor). Watch the resistance change using an ohmmeter attached to each terminal. It should vary smoothly with no sudden jumps. If the reading jumps suddenly, then repace the IAT sensor.\nHowever if the freeze frame reading was at the highest extreme (above 250 deg. F) then there was an intermittent low resistance on the signal circuit. Check for a short to ground on the signal circuit. If it appears OK, then do the above artificial heat test and replace the IAT as necessary. If the problem can\'t be duplicated, use a voltmeter to watch the signal voltage as you ""wiggle"" test the wiring harness. Watch for a sudden change in voltage indicating a short or open. Replace IAT as necessary.\nThis is a pretty simple code and it only really looks for extremely short changes that are relatively high in voltage.

I normally write this information down in case I need it later. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle. If the code is immediately reset, proceed with the diagnostic process.\nMost professional technicians begin with a visual inspection of IAT sensor related wiring and connectors (don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the air filter and the air inlet pipe). Pay careful attention to the sensor connector as it is susceptible to corrosion because of its close proximity to the battery and coolant reservoir.\nIf the system wiring, connectors, and components appear to be in working order, proceed by connecting the scanner to the diagnostic connector and opening the data stream. By narrowing the data stream to include only pertinent data, you will get a faster response. Use the infrared thermometer to make sure that the IAT reading (on the scanner) correctly reflects actual intake air temperature.\nIf it is incorrect, consult your vehicle information source for IAT sensor testing recommendations. Use the DVOM to test the sensor and compare your findings with vehicle specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply. \nIf the sensor passes the resistance test, check for a sensor reference voltage and a ground. If either one of these are not present repair the open or shorted circuit and retest the system. If system reference and ground signals are present, obtain an IAT sensor voltage to temperature chart from your vehicle information source and use the DVOM to test sensor output voltage. Compare the voltage with the voltage to temperature chart and replace the sensor if actual findings vary from maximum recommended tolerances.\nIf actual IAT input voltage is within specifications, disconnect the electrical connector/s from all related controllers and use the DVOM to test resistance and continuity on all system circuits.

When the air filter is checked or replaced, the IAT sensor is often left disconnected. If your vehicle has recently been service, and a code P0114 is suddenly stored, suspect that the IAT sensor has simply been left unplugged.\n\nRelated IAT sensor and circuit trouble codes: P0127\n'"

","b""\nFirst, visually check the sensor for damage to wiring or connector and repair as necessary. Then, if you have access to a scanner, determine what the temperature of the engine is. (If you don't have access to a scan tool, using the dash temperature gauge may not be an effective way to determine coolant temperature. This is because the P0115 code is referring to the ECT SENSOR, and the dash gauge is operated by, usually a one-wire SENDER. Basically a different sensor that the code doesn't refer to.)\n2. If the engine temperature is abnormally high, around 280 deg. F, that's abnormal. Unplug the sensor on the engine and see if the signal drops to, say, negative 50 deg. F. If it does, then it's a good bet the sensor is bad, internally shorted, causing a low resistance signal to be sent to the PCM. However if you want to be sure it's the sensor and not the wiring, there's a couple tests you can do. With the ECT sensor unplugged, check that you have 5 volts on the reference circuit with KOEO (Key on engine off). Also you can check the resistance of the sensor to ground using an Ohm meter. The resistance of a normal sensor to ground will vary a little depending on the vehicle, but basically, if the temp of the engine is around 200 deg. F., the resistance will be about 200 Ohms. If the temperature is about 0 def. F., the resistance will be over 10,000 Ohms. With this test you should be able to tell if the resistance of the sensor matches the temperature of the engine. If it's not accurate according to your engine's temperature, then you probably have a bad sensor.\n3. Now, if the temperature of the engine according to the scanner is around 280 deg. F. and unplugging the sensor doesn't cause the reading to drop to negative 50 deg. F, but it stays at the same high temperature reading, then you'll need to repair the short on the signal circuit(ground) to the PCM. It's shorted directly to ground somewhere.\n4. If your temperature reading of the engine according to the scanner is showing negative 50 deg. F or so, (and you don't live in the arctic!) unplug the sensor and check for a 5V reference present at the sensor.\n5. If there isn't, then check at the PCM connector for proper 5V reference. If it's present at the PCM connector, then repair the open or short on 5V reference from PCM. If there is no 5V reference present at the PCM connector, then you're done with your diagnosis and you may have a PCM fault. 6. If the 5V reference circuit is intact, then check the ground signal to the PCM using the previous ground resistance test. If the resistance isn't normal for the temperature of the engine, then ohm the resistance of the ground signal to the PCM by removing the ground signal wire from the PCM connector. The wire should have no resistance, unplugged from the PCM to the sensor. If it does, repair open in the signal to the PCM.

If the ECT reading is showing an excessively hot reading, for example more than 260 deg. F, then unplug the ECT sensor. This should cause the ECT reading to drop to the extreme cold reading (around -30 deg.F or so). If it does, replace the sensor, because it\'s internally shorted. If it doesn\'t change the reading, the check for a short to ground on the signal circuit of the ECT wiring. It could be that the two ECT wires are shorted to each other. Look for any chafing or melted wiring. Repair as necessary.\na. If you can\'t find any wiring problems and the ECT reading doesn\'t drop to the extreme coldest when unplugged, then, check for voltage coming out of the PCM on the signal wire\'s pin at the PCM connector. If there isn\'t any voltage, or it is low, then the PCM may be bad. NOTE: On some models it is possible for the 5 Volt reference signal to be temperarily shorted. This can happen if an engine sensor internally shorts the 5 Volt reference. Since the 5 Volt reference is a ""shared"" circuit on many models, this will cause it to be abnormally low. Usually, though this will be accompanied by several other sensor codes. If you suspect that may be the case, unplug each sensor until the 5 Volt reference reappears. The last sensor unplugged is the offending sensor. Replace and recheck the signal wire from the PCM connector\n2.

It should gradually sweep upwards to approximately 4.5 to 5 volts as you depress the throttle. Sometimes only a scope can capture an intermittent glitch in the TPS signal voltage. If you notice a glitch in the TPS sweep voltage, replace the TPS.\nNOTE: Some TPS sensors require fine adjustment. If you aren't comfortable with using a DVOM (Digital Volt Ohm meter) to adjust the new TPS, then it's best to take the vehicle to a shop.

With KOEO check for 5 volts reference voltage present at the connector and a good ground. You can check the signal circuit for continuity by jumping a fused wire between the ground circuit of the TPS connector and the signal circuit. If the TPS reading on the scan tool now reads zero, then replace the TPS. However if that doesn't change the reading to zero, then check for an open or a short on the signal wire and if none is found, suspect a bad PCM.

","b'\nIt should be stated right off the bat that the most common problem associated with this code is the MAF sensor or air mass meter. This is especially the case with Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and other European cars. At time of writing, you don\'t normally see this code with American-made cars, and minimally with Asian, and, to be honest, I have no idea why. It appears to me that the PCM (powertrain control module) logic used by some European car manufacturers to set a P0170 (or P0173) fault code simply isn\'t used by American vehicle manufacturers. It is more common to see P0171, 0174, 0172, 0175 codes set with regard to fuel trim malfunctions on American cars. There is very little information on the setting conditions for a P0170, or P0173, but what information that is available almost seems to be a redundancy of the P0171,4,2 &amp; 5 setting conditions. I\'m sure there\'s a reason for it, but I can\'t get anyone to tell me what that is. The similarities between them may be why we don\'t see this code surface on domestic vehicles very often. It\'s simply unnecessary. So, simply put, if you have a P0170, your PCM noticed that the fuel trims reached their rich correction limit. Basically it\'s adding fuel to try to compensate for a lean condition, real or perceived.\nIf you have this code and access to a scan tool, observe the MAF sensor reading in grams/sec. The reading will be different for different automobiles, so get a good spec. I\'m going to stick with what would be normal for a Mercedes (1.8L), since they have the bulk of the trouble. Expect to see at idle 3.5-5 g/s (ideally). At 2500 RPMs with no load it should be between 9 and 12 g/s. On road test, at WOT (wide open throttle) it should be 90 g/s or well above. If it\'s not in specs, replace it. Be careful of Ebay MAFs. Often they don\'t work according to OE specifications. If the MAF checks out and there is no oil intrusion at the connector, check fuel pressure and ensure that there are no leaks at the regulator internally or externally. Check all vacuum hoses and confirm none are cracked, disconnected or missing. Make sure there are no vacuum leaks at the intake manifold gaskets or tears in the air supply hose. If the engine is turbo charged, be sure the hoses are in good condition and have no leaks. Leaking turbo pressure hoses could cause a rich condition. Inspect the condition of crankcase vent hose under intake manifold and operation of check valve in the hose. (In the ""What are the causes?"" section) If there doesn\'t appear to be any problems with the fuel pressure, MAF or vacuum hoses, then inspect the O2 sensor connectors for oil intrusion. A bad O2 sensor could cause a P0170, or P0173. Repair cause of oil leak and replace oil-fouled O2 sensor.\n'"

Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner, with an integrated DVOM and an oscilloscope, is possibly the best tool for diagnosing a code P0189. A vehicle information source (like All Data DIY) and an infrared thermometer can also be very beneficial.\nAn appropriate beginning to any diagnosis is a visual inspection of all related wiring harnesses and connectors. Damaged, burnt, or corroded wiring and connectors must be repaired or replaced. Next, you will want to clear the codes and retest the system. I like to utilize the OBD II readiness mode when multiple failure cycles are required for MIL illumination. When the repairs are completed, clear the codes then drive the vehicle normally. Your repairs were successful if the PCM enters readiness mode. The malfunction still exists if the code is reset. A five-volt reference signal and a ground are supplied to the fuel composition sensor which is of the variable resistance variety. The fuel composition sensor completes the circuit and provides the PCM with a fluctuating fuel temperature voltage signal. Test reference voltage and ground at the fuel temp sensor connector using the DVOM. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t find reference voltage at the fuel temperature sensor connector, use the DVOM to test corresponding circuits at the PCM connector. If no reference voltage is discovered at the PCM connector, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error. Contemplate PCM failure only as a last resort.\nUsing the oscilloscope, you can monitor live data in waveform patterns if the reference and ground are both present at the fuel temperature sensor connector. Use the infrared thermometer to obtain actual fuel temperature and compare it with the temperature revealed by the waveform patterns on the oscilloscope. If the fuel temperature, revealed by the waveform voltage patterns, fails to coincide with that of the thermometer, suspect that the fuel temperature sensor is bad.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Use the DVOM to test fuel temperature sensor resistance according to manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations\nNOTE: Disconnect all related controllers prior to testing circuit resistance with the DVOM \n\n'"

It may look similar to this one:\n\nOnce located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for chafing, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or possibly green in color versus the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some Electrical Contact cleaner at any parts store if cleaning of the terminals is needed. If this is not possible, find some 91% rubbing alcohol and a light plastic bristle brush to clean them with. Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the sensor and its associated circuits. Typically there are 3 wires at the FRP sensor. Disconnect the harness going to the FRP Sensor. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), test the 5V power supply circuit going to the sensor to insure it is being powered up (Red lead to the 5V power supply circuit, black lead to a good ground). If there is 12 volts to the sensor when there should be 5 volts, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor for a short to 12 volts, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 5V on the FRP Sensor signal circuit (Red lead to the sensor signal circuit, black lead to a good ground). If there is no 5 volts to the sensor, or if you see 12 volts to the sensor, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor, or once again a possible bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at the FRP sensor. Connect a test light to 12V battery positive (red terminal) and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to the FRP Sensor circuit ground. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to the FRP sensor to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf all tests have passed and you still get a code P0190, this would most likely indicate a failed PCM. A hard reset (battery disconnect) would recommended before any PCM replacement could be justified. A Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor may have to be replaced as well.\n\n'"

","b""\n1. If you have multiple misfire/injector codes, a good first step is to unplug all the fuel injectors and then turn the ignition on, engine off (KOEO). Check for presence of battery voltage (12 Volts) at one wire of each injector connector. If all are missing, check for continuity to ground on the voltage circuit by using a test light connected to positive battery and probe each voltage feed. If it lights up, then there is a short to ground on the voltage feed causing a short. Get a wiring diagram and repair the short on the voltage feed and reestablish proper battery voltage. (Don't forget to check for a blown fuse and replace as necessary). NOTE: It's possible for one injector to short out the whole battery voltage feed to all the injectors. So if you have lost voltage to all the injectors, replace the blown fuse and plug each injector in, one by one. If the fuse blows, the last injector you plugged in is shorted. Replace it and retest. If only one or two battery feeds are missing, then it's more likely to be a shorted battery voltage feed in the individual injector wiring harness. Inspect and repair as necessary.\n2. If you have battery voltage fed to each injector harness, then the next step is to get a noid light to check for injector driver operation. A noid light will insert into the injector harness in place of the fuel injector and flash rapidly when the injector driver operates. Check each fuel injector connector. If the noid light flashes rapidly then suspect the injector. Ohm each fuel injector if you have a resistance specification. If the injector is open or the resistance is higher or lower than the spec, replace the fuel injector. If the injector tests out, the problem is likely an intermittent wiring problem. (Remember that a fuel injector can work properly when cold but go open when hot, or vice versa. So it's best to do these checks when the problem is occurring). Check the wiring harness for any chafing, or the injector connector for loose pins or a broken lock. Repair as necessary and retest.

If so, check the timing and adjust if necessary.\nIf you think that you may have a fuel delivery problem, then check the lift pump operation. On Dodge Ram with the Cummins engine, the lift pump should produce about 45 oz of diesel in 25 seconds of operation. This can be performed by disconnecting the fuel hose from the injection pump and pumping the fuel into an approved container. Bump the engine over but do not start it. Then the lift pump will operate for 25 seconds. If the fuel is aerated, then check/repair fuel line and recheck.\nWith the fuel hose connected the fuel pressure should be 10psi. If the fuel delivery tests fail, replace the diesel fuel filter and recheck.\nIf it still fails then verify there are no restrictions in the fuel tank\n Then replace the lift (transfer) pump. IT SHOULD BE NOTED that if this code surfaced after a routine fuel filter replacement or if you have any of the above symptoms after routine fuel filter replacement, then suspect the fuel transfer pump. This occurs because even a weak transfer pump can still provide enough fuel for the engine to run. But when the fuel system\\'s prime is lost due to fuel filter replacement, it may not restart again without fixing the fuel delivery problem.\nIf you found your injection pump to be bad, the lift pump should be checked for operation to protect the new injection pump. This is because weak or low output from lift pump are common cause of injection pump failure. There are some aftermarket kits that can be purchased to warn the operator when the fuel pressure/volume drops to level that could damage the injection pump.\n"""

","b""\nStart by checking the coolant level ON A COLD ENGINE. It's never a good idea to check the coolant on a hot or overheated engine. Also, putting cold water in an overheated, empty cooling system causes thermal shock and isn't a good idea.\nIf you find your cooling system is low on coolant and you have a P0217 stored, inspect the system for leaks and repair as necessary. Then change the thermostat (see note below) and after refilling the cooling system, restart the engine and verify it isn't overheating. Be aware that it's possible for an overheated engine to expel the coolant out of the radiator cap to protect the cooling system from over-pressurization. If you can't locate a leak, this may be the reason.\nFollow the steps below to check the performance of the cooling system. If the coolant level is normal, check the radiator and A/C condenser for any type of restriction that could impede airflow. This step may require removing the radiator and visually inspecting it outside of the vehicle. Check in between the radiator and the condenser for restriction or debris. Make sure all the plastic panels that direct airflow into the radiator are in place. If you have access to a scan tool, check the cooling fans for operation or abnormal noise indicating a bearing failure. Look down into the radiator tank (if possible) and observe the condition. Is there a lot of buildup that may restrict coolant flow? If so, replace the radiator.\nIf you don't notice any apparent problems, and the vehicle continues to overheat, feel the upper radiator hose. Is it hot, indicating that the coolant is flowing freely? If not, the water pump impeller may be damaged or broken causing a no-flow condition. If the water pump appears to be working properly, the thermostat may be faulty. Replace it and re-check. If after the above checks, you still have problems with overheating and coolant being expelled from the system, you may have combustion gasses leaking into the cooling system. This would require a combustion gas leak-test on the cooling system. If you have a P0217 but the vehicle isn't overheating, there may be a faulty coolant temperature sender.\nNote: An overheated engine can effectively ruin the thermostat.

","b'\nIf you have access to a scan tool, with KOEO (Key on engine off) observe the TPS voltage. With throttle closed, voltage should be about .45 volts. It should gradually sweep upwards to approximately 4.5 to 5 volts as you depress the throttle. Sometimes only a scope can capture an intermittent glitch in the TPS signal voltage. If you notice a glitch in the TPS sweep voltage, replace the TPS.\nNOTE: Some TPS sensors require fine adjustment. If you aren\'t comfortable with using a DVOM (Digital Volt Ohm meter) to adjust the new TPS, then it\'s best to take the vehicle to a shop. If the voltage is not .45 volts (+or- .3 volts or so) with the throttle closed or if the reading is ""stuck"" then unplug the TPS connector. With KOEO check for 5 volts reference voltage present at the connector and a good ground. You can check the signal circuit for continuity by jumping a fused wire between the ground circuit of the TPS connector and the signal circuit. If the TPS reading on the scan tool now reads zero, then replace the TPS. However if that doesn\'t change the reading to zero, then check for an open or a short on the signal wire and if none is found, suspect a bad PCM. If manipulating the TPS wiring harness causes any change in idle, then suspect bad TPS.\n'"

If the fuel pump won't activate and deactivate, then remove the relay and visually check for discoloration due to heat or loose terminals. If okay, install a test light between the control circuit ignition feed and ground driver terminals (If you're not sure, don't attempt).\nThe test light should illuminate when the key is on or the fuel pump is commanded on.

If the vehicle will start and run and no drivability complaints are present, then suspect an open in the feedback circuit between the PCM and where it splices into the fuel pump supply voltage circuit. Repair as necessary.\nIf the vehicle doesn't start or starts and dies due to low fuel pressure, check the fuel pump fuse. If it's blown check for a short to ground on the fuel pump voltage supply circuit. Do this by removing the FP relay and then check the resistance between the voltage supply circuit at the fuel pump connector and ground. If you have little resistance indicating a short to ground, unplug the fuel pump and check again. If it shows high or infinite resistance after unplugging the fuel pump, replace the shorted fuel pump. If the resistance is still low after unplugging the fuel pump then repair short in the FP voltage supply circuit\n If the resistance check is showing that the fuel pump supply circuit is okay then re-check between the FP fuse and the FP relay. There has to be a short somewhere. Check for wiring harness chafing in certain areas. Repair as necessary. If the fuel pump fuse isn't blown and the vehicle won't start or starts and stalls due to low fuel pressure then remove the fuse and check that voltage is present to the fuse. Then check that voltage is traveling from the fuse to the FP relay by re-installing the FP fuse and checking for battery voltage at the FP relay. If the FP fuse or the FP relay doesn't have voltage supplied to it, the fuel pump will not operate. Find the open in the circuit and repair as necessary. If both the FP fuse and the FP relay have sufficient voltage, remove the FP relay and install a fused jumper wire to complete the FP voltage supply circuit (Usually you do this by jumping terminals 30 &amp; 87 in most relays-check a wiring diagram to be sure). If the fuel pump runs, replace the faulty FP relay and recheck. If the fuel pump doesn't run check for voltage present (with jumper connected or by cycling the ignition key with FP relay installed) at the fuel pump connector at the fuel tank.

If the voltage remains, or the fuel pump continues to run, then there is a short to voltage on the FP voltage supply circuit or on the feedback circuit. Repair as necessary. If the voltage disappears (or the pump quits running) with the FP relay removed then try replacing the relay with a spare one. Upon reinstalling the spare relay, if the voltage disappears, the relay was faulty due to a short. If, though, after replacing the relay voltage is still present, suspect that the PCM FP relay control circuit is shorted to ground.\nCheck for a short to ground on the PCM FP relay control (ground driver) circuit by removing the FP relay and ohm between a good ground and the PCM FP relay control. There should be no continuity to ground with KOEO (after the FP pre-cycle is completed). If there is continuity to ground the wire is shorted. Find the short to ground and repair as necessary. If you can find no physical short, It may be necessary to snip the FP relay control wire close to the PCM connector where it will be easy to repair and check for continuity to ground with KOEO coming OUT of the PCM.

","b'\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source will be among the tools required to diagnose a code P0297.\nAllow me to begin by suggesting that you make sure that the vehicle has not been operated above the maximum allowable speed. If the vehicle has been inadvertently operated above the maximum speed, connect the diagnostic scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored codes. You will want to write this information down (along with any available freeze frame data) as it can be helpful as your diagnosis unfolds. \nNow, simply clear the code and test-drive the vehicle to make sure that it is not reset. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or a code is stored. If the code P0297 is stored after being cleared, you know that there is a malfunction. If the PCM enters readiness mode, you are good-to-go. If the P0297 is reset, and there are no other transmission symptoms or codes, suspect a VSS problem. \nTest the VSS\nUnplug the electrical connector from the VSS and use the DVOM to test the resistance of the sensor itself. Consult your vehicle information source for specific testing procedures and specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommended specs.\nTest Reference Voltage and Ground\nIf the VSS is within specifications, check for reference voltage and a ground at the sensor connector. With the sensor unplugged, use the DVOM to check for an acceptable reference voltage signal (usually 5-volts) and a ground on the appropriate pins. If there is not an acceptable reference voltage signal at the VSS connector, use the DVOM to test the corresponding circuit at the PCM connector. If you discover an acceptable reference voltage signal at the PCM connector, suspect a defective wire, splice, or connector between the PCM and the VSS. A false overspeed condition is more likely to be caused by a circuit that is shorted to voltage than an open circuit. If there is no ground at the VSS connector, consult your vehicle information source for the location of system grounds and carefully check them with the DVOM. Make repairs as required.\nTest VSS System Circuits\nIf the reference and ground are both present at the VSS connector, test all VSS system circuits. Prior to using the DVOM to test continuity on system circuits, disconnect all related controllers. Test individual system circuits using the DVOM and repair or replace any circuits which do not adhere to manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications. If all system circuits are in order, suspect a defective PCM. \n PCM failure is rare\nActual overspeed vehicle operation is the leading cause of a stored code P0297\n\n'"

While it is always a good idea to visually inspect system wiring and connectors prior to beginning your diagnosis in this case, it is most important that you make sure that the engine is full (to the appropriate limit and with the correct type) of good quality oil and engine coolant.\nA note about overheating\nEngine overheating is the leading cause of oil over temp conditions. Engine overheating may be the result of a coolant leak, a bad thermostat, cylinder head (or gasket) malfunctions, or an air flow problem. Make sure that the engine cooling system is filled with coolant and that all of the fans are operating as intended. If the engine cooling system is more than a half-gallon low, locate the source of the coolant leak and repair it.\nWith the engine cooling system filled with the proper coolant and working normally and the crankcase properly filled with oil, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Having this information written down can be helpful as your diagnosis proceeds. After you have made a note of all stored codes and related data, clear the codes and operate the vehicle to see if the P0298 is reset.\nIf the engine is not overheating:\n\n And the engine oil temperature sensor code fails to reset, continue to operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or the code is reset.

","b""\nIt's important to start by going online and checking all the relevant TSBs (technical service bulletins) relating to this code. If the fuel system is not the problem, several vehicles have a peculiar problem that tends to set this code. \nFor example, BMWs have a set of three oil separator hoses beneath the intake manifold that when cracked, create a vacuum leak that sets this code.\nCheck your factory and extended warranty to see if it is still covered, and for how long. \nPurchase a code scanner from your local auto parts store, or borrow one. They are relatively inexpensive and not only retrieve the codes, but they have an accompanying code cross-reference sheet for explanations and can reset the computer upon completion. \nConnect the scanner to the OBD port below the dash on the driver's side. Turn the key to &quot;On&quot; and depress the &quot;Read&quot; button. Make a note of all the codes and cross-reference them with the code sheet. Additional codes could be present that will direct you to a particular area, such as: \n\nP0004 Fuel Volume Regulator Control Circuit High \nP0091 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit Low \nP0103 Mass or Volume Air Flow Circuit High Input \nP0267 Cylinder 3 Injector Circuit Low\nP0304 Cylinder 4 Misfire Detected \n\nRepair any additional code(s) and retest by clearing the code with the scanner and test driving the vehicle. \nIf no supporting codes are present, then start with the fuel filter. The following diagnosis and repair procedures require a few special tools: \n\nSpecial fuel filter removal wrenches \nFuel pressure tester and adapters \nFuel can \nVolt/Ohmmeter \n\nMake sure there is at least a half a tank of fuel. \n\nConnect the fuel pressure tester to the fuel test port on the fuel rail. Open the valve on the tester and allow the fuel pressure to drain into a gas can. Close the valve on the tester. \nRaise the vehicle and replace the fuel filter. \nTurn the key on and check for leaks. \nPull the connector to the fuel pump module loose and check for voltage at the fuel pump. To do this a helper will need to cycle the key on for five seconds and off for five. The computer energizes the pump for two seconds. If the computer does not see the engine turning it shuts the fuel pump off. \nProbe the terminals in the connector for power. At the same time listen to the pump energize. If there is no sound or an unusual sound the pump is failing. Make sure the wiring harness and connector are in good shape. \nLower the vehicle and start the engine. Make a note of the fuel pressure at an idle. If the engine runs better and the fuel pressure is within limits as per the service manual the problem is repaired. \nIf this failed to resolve the problem, look for any vacuum leaks going to the intake manifold. \nPull the vacuum hose off the fuel pressure regulator. Look for fuel inside the hose. Fuel means the diaphragm failed. \n\nIf the fuel pump is faulty, take it to a service facility to replace. It makes technicians nervous when dropping the fuel tank. One spark can bring disaster. Don't attempt it at home, lest you blow up your house and the surrounding homes if an unfortunate accident should occur. \n \n\n \n"""
"P0314
","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nNext, note if there are any other diagnostic fault codes. If any of them are ignition system/fuel system related, diagnose them first. Misdiagnosis has been known to occur if a technician diagnoses this code before any ignition system / fuel system related codes have been thoroughly diagnosed and dismissed. Insure there are no intake or exhaust leaks. An intake leak, or vacuum leak, makes the engine run lean. An exhaust leak gives the impression of a lean running engine by the air/fuel ratio sensor/oxygen sensor (AFR/O2).\nAfter that, clear all diagnostic trouble codes and see if the P0314 returns. If it does not, then the problem was intermittent or the P0314 was a memory code, that is it was something in the past.\nIf the code resets, that is comes right back the next time you start the vehicle or the very next road test, further inspection is required. Locate the CKP sensor and the CMP sensor on your particular vehicle. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burned spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the plastic connectors. See if they look burnt or corroded in place of the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush at any parts store if you need to clean the terminals. If this is not possible, find some rubbing alcohol and a toothbrush to clean them with, just make sure you do not put the toothbrush back in the bathroom! Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nClear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory again, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, remove the CKP sensor and the CMP sensor from the engine. Look at the end of the sensor where it comes close to the timing components / flex plate / flywheel on the engine. Note if there is any damage to it, where it may have been struck by any of those components. If it looks like it may have been struck / damaged, it will need to be replaced. At this point in time, it is a wise suggestion to replace it with one from the OEM, or dealer. On several occasions, techs have replaced a bad CKP sensor, only to find they must replace them again because the aftermarket sensor did not meet the voltage specifications that the PCM was looking for. With this code, relating to these two sensors, be more suspect of the CMP sensor, as the CKP sensor would tend to cause the engine to die. The CMP sensor could cause it to lose its ability to identify individual cylinders. \nIf the prior tests have passed and the code is still present, monitor the air/fuel ratio sensor/oxygen sensor (AFR/O2). If it continually indicates that the engine is running lean, locate any and all possibilities that could cause a lean running/misfiring engine. These include:\n\nIntake or exhaust leaks \nFuel system, including fuel pressure/fuel pressure regulator\nFuel pressure sensor \nFuel injectors \nIgnition system \nO2 sensor after the catalytic converter\nEVAP system, to include the canister purge regulator valve.\n\n\nIf the code still cannot be cleared, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive drivability diagnostician.\n'"

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nAfter that, if you have a scan tool, note all diagnostic trouble codes that are set along with the P0315. Next, clear all diagnostic trouble codes and see if the P0315 returns. If it does not, then the problem was intermittent or the P0315 was a memory code, that is it was something in the past.\nIf the code resets, that is comes right back the next time you start or try to start the engine, or the very next road test further inspection is required. Locate the Crankshaft Position Sensor on your particular vehicle. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for chafing, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or there is green funk in place of the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some Electrical Contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush at any parts store if you need to clean the terminals. If this is not possible, find some rubbing alcohol and a toothbrush to clean them with, just make sure you do not put the toothbrush back in the bathroom!

On several occasions, techs have replaced bad CPS sensors, only to find they must replace them again because the aftermarket sensor did not meet the voltage specifications that the PCM was looking for. While the CPS sensor is removed, look into the opening where the CPS sensor came from. As you slowly turn the engine over by hand (a socket is on the large bolt on the balancer, a ratchet or breaker bar is on the socket and the keys to the car are in your pocket, not anywhere near the ignition; prevents the risk of accidental engine start while barring the engine over), note any issues with the timing components. See if the tone wheel teeth are intact and not cracked. Insure that as you begin to turn there is very little slack in the timing chain / components. If unsure, install a new OEM CPS sensor and retest.\nIf the prior tests have passed and the code is still present, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory again and see if your scan tool provides support for Crankshaft Position Relearn. If it does, perform this procedure. Once again, Insure All Codes Are Cleared Prior to Performing this procedure! If not, the procedure will not complete and the code will reset.\nIf the code still cannot be cleared, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician.\n'"
"P0316
","b""\nFirst off, you'll want to repair any other misfire DTC codes if present prior to diagnosing this code. If you own a Ford vehicle and you have a P0316 along with one of the other misfire codes, you should check for appropriate TSBs (technical service bulletins), as there are some TSBs that in part involve reprogramming the PCM. Doing that requires specialized equipment. Some Ford vehicles even needed a new cylinder head as a result of the valve. Regardless, if you have a Ford with multiple misfire codes including this one, check for TSBs.\nIf the P0316 is the only code, then it's time to do a bit more diagnosing of the crankshaft and camshaft position sensors, and their associated connectors and wiring. A tip we've found is &quot;Since this code indicates a start up misfire, pay attention to items which may expand or contract when cold (if the code sets when the engine is cold), or hot (if the code sets on a hot restart).&quot;\nRealistically, the freeze frame data from the PCM will be helpful in tracking down the problem. As will a good DVOM (digital volt-ohm meter), so you can perform tests on the wiring and the sensors.\n \n\n \n"""

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nNext, locate the ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor on your particular vehicle. This may be a crank sensor/cam sensor; it might be a pick up coil/sensor inside the distributor; it may even be a wire coming from the coil going to the PCM to verify ignition system firing. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nDepending upon the vehicle, the most likely cause for the P0320 to set is poor connections/updated ignition parts. This is why a TSB search on your vehicle cannot be stressed enough.\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P0320 returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0320 code does return, we will need to test the sensor and its associated circuits. The next steps will be determined by which type of sensor you have: Hall Effect or Magnetic Pick up. You can usually tell which one you have by the number of wires coming from the sensor. If there are 3 wires from the sensor, it is a Hall Effect sensor. If it has 2 wires, it will be a Magnetic Pick up style sensor.\nIf it is a Hall Effect sensor, disconnect the harness going to the Camshaft and the Crankshaft Position Sensors. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), test the 5V power supply circuit going to each sensor to insure it is being powered up (Red lead to the 5V power supply circuit, black lead to a good ground). If there is no 5 volts to the sensor, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor, or possible a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 5V on each signal circuit going to each sensor to insure it has a signal circuit (Red lead to the sensor signal circuit, black lead to a good ground).

Connect a test light to 12V and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to each sensor. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to each sensor to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf it is a Magnetic Pickup style sensor, we can check the sensor itself to see if it is working properly. We will test it for: 1) Resistance 2) A/C voltage output 3) Short to ground\nWith the sensor disconnected, connect the two leads of your ohmmeter to the 2 terminals of the Camshaft / Crankshaft Position Sensor. Read the ohms resistance and compare it to specifications for your vehicle: typically 750 \xe2\x80\x93 2000 ohms. While still on ohms, disconnect 1 lead of your ohmmeter from the sensor and connect it to a good ground on the vehicle. If you get any ohms reading other than infinite or OL, the sensor has an internal short to ground. Remember not to touch the metal part of the leads with your fingers, as this may affect your readings.\nReconnect the two leads of your DVOM to the 2 terminals of the Camshaft / Crankshaft Position Sensor. Set your meter to read A/C voltage. While cranking the engine over, read the a/c voltage output on your DVOM. Compare to manufacturers specifications for your vehicle. A good rule of thumb is generally .5V AC. \nIf all tests have passed so far, and you continue to get a P0320 code, this would most likely indicate a failed ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the sensor had been replaced. In some instances, once the sensor has been replaced, it will need to be calibrated to the PCM in order to function properly.\n If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician.

If there is no 5 volts to the sensor, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor, or possible a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 5V on each signal circuit going to each sensor to insure it has a signal circuit (Red lead to the sensor signal circuit, black lead to a good ground). If there is no 5 volts to the sensor, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor, or possible a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at each sensor. Connect a test light to 12V and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to each sensor. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to each sensor to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf it is a Magnetic Pickup style sensor, we can check the sensor itself to see if it is working properly. We will test it for: 1) Resistance 2) A/C voltage output 3) Short to ground\nWith the sensor disconnected, connect the two leads of your ohmmeter to the 2 terminals of the Camshaft / Crankshaft Position Sensor. Read the ohms resistance and compare it to specifications for your vehicle: typically 750 \xe2\x80\x93 2000 ohms. While still on ohms, disconnect 1 lead of your ohmmeter from the sensor and connect it to a good ground on the vehicle. If you get any ohms reading other than infinite or OL, the sensor has an internal short to ground. Remember not to touch the metal part of the leads with your fingers, as this may affect your readings.\nReconnect the two leads of your DVOM to the 2 terminals of the Camshaft / Crankshaft Position Sensor. Set your meter to read A/C voltage. While cranking the engine over, read the a/c voltage output on your DVOM. Compare to manufacturers specifications for your vehicle. A good rule of thumb is generally .5V AC. \nIf all tests have passed so far, and you continue to get a P0323 code, this would most likely indicate a failed ignition/distributor/engine speed sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the sensor had been replaced. In some instances, once the sensor has been replaced, it will need to be calibrated to the PCM in order to function properly.\n If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

Since they share common power and ground circuits, and this code focuses around the power and ground circuits of the Camshaft Position Sensor, it only makes sense to check them to see if there is damage to either one.\nExample photo of a camshaft position sensor (CMP):\n\nOnce located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for chafing, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or possibly green in color versus the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some Electrical Contact cleaner at any parts store if cleaning of the terminals is needed. If this is not possible, find some 91% rubbing alcohol and a light plastic bristle brush to clean them with. Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns.

"P0350
","b'\nIn order to diagnose a code P0350, I would need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source, such as ALL DATA (DIY).\nA visual inspection of all ignition coil/pack wiring and connectors is the best place to begin your diagnosis of a code P0350. Be on the lookout for broken electrical connectors at the ignition coils or coil packs. Also check for wiring that is burned, broken, or corroded. I have personally found rodent damaged wiring to be the cause of a code P0350 in several customer cars. Ignition coil electrical connector ends are also known for becoming corroded over time.\nI would continue by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieving all the stored codes and freeze frame data. I have found it helpful to record this information for later. Next, I\xe2\x80\x99d clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle to see if the P0350 is reset.\nUse your vehicle information source to search technical service bulletins (TSB) that may help with your diagnosis. TSBs with matching symptoms and codes can prove very helpful if you use the diagnostic tips found therein.\nIf there are cylinder specific ignition coil primary /secondary circuit codes present, they may help you to pin point the defective circuit or coil/pack. If there are no cylinder specific codes present, you will need to find out which coil, coil pack, or circuit is malfunctioning. This can be done by testing the coils or coil packs for the correct level of Hertz when high-intensity spark is emitted but I use a simpler method. With the engine running and the parking brake set, I use an assistant to sit in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat. He presses the brake firmly to the floor, places the shifter in drive, and depresses the accelerator pedal slightly but gradually. When the engine begins to misfire, my assistant holds the accelerator pedal in that position, while I systematically remove each spark plug wire/boot from the spark plug (you can also unplug each coil pack electrical connector, if you\xe2\x80\x99d rather, to avoid the pitfalls of being subjected to more than 50,000-volts of high-intensity spark). \nWhen you discover a coil or coil pack tower that makes no difference in engine RPM when the plug wire/boot is removed from the spark plug; you have found the cylinder number of the coil/pack at fault. You will probably notice that the level of high-intensity spark emitted from the malfunctioning coil/pack is significantly less than those which are functioning properly. Be sure to clear codes after performing this test. Once you have located the coil/pack in question, use the DVOM to test for battery voltage at the coil/pack connector when the ignition is on. If there is no voltage present, use the vehicle information source to find the voltage source so that you may check blown fuses, defective relays, etc. Remember that blown fuses are a reaction to an electrical short and not the source of a malfunction. If all fuses and relays are good, use the DVOM to probe individual circuits for continuity and resistance. Disconnect all related controllers before doing this to prevent damage to the sensitive electronics found onboard. Repair or replace circuits which fail to comply with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations (found in the vehicle information source).\nIf the voltage signal is present at the ignition coil/pack, test the coil connector for a ground pulse from the PCM. If no ground pulse is present (when the engine is cranked or running), suspect a defective driver in the PCM if no other ignition codes (including crankshaft position and camshaft position sensor codes) are present.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n A maintenance tune-up is NOT a fix for a code P0350\nUse caution when testing high-intensity spark in the vicinity of flammable liquids \n\n \n\n \n'"

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner and an accurate vehicle information source (like All Data DIY) will be required to diagnose a code P0363.\nSince a code P0363 is essentially a reaction to a stored cylinder misfire code, you will need to diagnose any stored cylinder misfire codes (P0301 through P0312) before attempting to diagnose this code. Although there are numerous tools designed to test ignition coil, spark plug, and fuel injector function, the simple method of swapping components between cylinders has proven effective for me for more years than I care to declare. This may not always be feasible with the fuel injectors but it works well with ignition coils and spark plugs, which fail far more regularly than fuel injectors. For more tips on diagnosing cylinder misfire codes, see the appropriate entry in OBD II Codes.\nYou will still need the scanner to retrieve stored codes and freeze frame data. The scanner is also used to clear codes after you have written them down for reference as the diagnostic process continues. Once you have accomplished these things, clear the codes and you are set to begin swapping components for testing purposes. Obviously, spark plugs will need to be replaced in sets if the vehicle in question is near the recommended replacement interval. Nevertheless, locate the malfunctioning part prior to performing any maintenance. When replacing an ignition coil for a particular cylinder, spark plug replacement is recommended (unless the spark plugs have been recently replaced). This will save you time in the long run.\nThe problem that creates a ton of confusion is that, when some technicians discover that there is no ground pulse to the injector for the cylinder in question, they treat it as a malfunction instead of a reaction (caused by the PCM) to an ignition misfire. This can have you chasing your tail if you are unfamiliar with the fuel disabling system used in some models.\nIf the P0363 is stored without any cylinder misfire codes, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n The P0363 code must be cleared before the ground pulse will be restored to the injector for the cylinder in question\nWhen using the swapping method to test spark plugs, use caution removing plugs from aluminum cylinder heads. The threads (in the aluminum) are very fragile and may be damaged if not allowed to cool properly.\n\n \n\n \n'"

Look for chafing, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or possibly green in color versus the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some Electrical Contact cleaner at any parts store if cleaning of the terminals is needed. If this is not possible, find some 91% rubbing alcohol and a light plastic bristle brush to clean them with. Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the sensor and its associated circuits. Typically there are 2 types of Camshaft Position Sensors: Hall Effect or Magnetic Pick up. You can typically tell which one you have by the number of wires coming from the sensor. If there are 3 wires from the sensor, it is a Hall Effect sensor. If it has 2 wires, it will be a Magnetic Pick up style sensor.\nThis code will only set if the sensor is a Hall Effect sensor. Disconnect the harness going to the Camshaft Position Sensor. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), test the 5V power supply circuit going to the sensor to insure it is being powered up (Red lead to the 5V/12V power supply circuit, black lead to a good ground). Verify with a wiring diagram or diagnostic chart if this sensor is powered up with 5 volts or 12 volts. If there is 12 volts to the sensor when there should be 5 volts, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor for a short to 12 volts, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 5V on the Camshaft Position Sensor signal circuit (Red lead to the sensor signal circuit, black lead to a good ground).

Connect a test light to 12V battery positive (red terminal) and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to the Camshaft Sensor circuit ground.

While still on ohms, disconnect 1 lead of your ohmmeter from the sensor and connect it to a good ground on the vehicle. If you get any ohms reading other than infinite or OL, the sensor has an internal short to ground. Remember not to touch the metal part of the leads with your fingers, as this may affect your readings.\nReconnect the two leads of your DVOM to the 2 terminals of the Camshaft / Crankshaft Position Sensor.

Connect one meter lead to the sensor signal wire and the other to ground.

If available, you can also use an oscilloscope to view the signal pulses while cranking the engine. \n Permanent magnet sensor: begin by checking the internal resistance of the sensor. Disconnect the sensor electrical connector and connect a digital multimeter set to ohms to each of the sensor terminals. The resistance should be approximately 500 to 1,200 ohms. Consult the factory repair information for the exact specification. If the resistance test is OK, you'll want to test the sensor performance. To do this, reconnect the sensor electrical connector.

If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit on the ground side of the circuit, which needs to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.\n Check the reference voltage side of the circuit: with the ignition on, use a digital multimeter set to volts to check for reference from the PCM (typically 5 volts) at one of the three sensor terminals. If no reference signal is present, connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the reference voltage terminal on the sensor and the reference voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity. Next, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the return signal side of the circuit: with the ignition off, use a digital multimeter set to ohms to check for continuity between the engine position sensor output terminal and the signal voltage terminal on the PCM.

Other than that, they differ in their methods for regulating the opening of the pintle and sensing its position.\nThe following repair procedures represent the most common problems accounting for the majority of failures in the EGR system. Wiring harness or sensor failures require a service manual to determine the proper wire identification and diagnostic procedures. \nKeep in mind that the wiring differs between manufacturers and computers do not react well if the wrong wire is probed. If you probe the wrong wire and send excessive voltage through the computer's sensor input terminal and the computer will fry. \nAt the same time, if the wrong connector is disconnected the computer could lose its programming causing the vehicle to fail to start again until the dealer reprograms the computer. \n\nThe code P0409 indicates a circuit malfunction, so check the EGR sensor connector for corrosion, bent or pushed out terminals or loose connection. Clean off any corrosion and re-seat the connector. \nRemove the electrical connector and remove the EGR. Check for coking in the EGRs intake and exhaust. Clean out any coking as necessary so the pintle will move up and down smoothly. \nCheck the vacuum line from the EGR to the solenoid and replace it if any defects are found.\nCheck the solenoid electrical connector for corrosion or defects. \nIf the vehicle is a Ford, follow the two vacuum hoses from the EGR to the differential pressure feedback EGR sensor (DPFE) in the rear of the manifold. \nCheck the two pressure hoses for corrosion. Experience dictates these hoses plug with carbon from the exhaust. Use a small pocket screwdriver or equivalent and clean the hoses of corrosion and the sensor will begin to operate again. \n\nIf the most common tests failed to solve the problem, a service manual is needed to continue to test the wiring circuits. The best solution is to take the vehicle to a service facility with the proper diagnostic equipment. They can quickly identify and repair this type of problem. \nRelated EGR codes: P0408\n"""

Repair\nas required.\nUse a scope to diagnose the oxygen sensor operation (Tip: The oxygen sensor\nin front of the catalytic converter normally has a fluctuating waveform. The\nwaveform of the sensor behind the converter should be more steady).\nInspect the downstream heated oxygen sensor, replace if necessary\nReplace the catalytic converter\n\nDiagnostic Tip\nGenerally speaking you can look at the temperature of the exhaust just before and just after the converter using an infrared temperature gun. The output should be about 100 degrees Fahrenheit hotter when the engine is fully warmed up.\nOverall probably the biggest mistake vehicles owners make when they have a P0420 code is to simply replace an oxygen sensor (02 sensor). It is important to do proper diagnosis so you're not wasting money replacing parts unnecessarily.\nWe strongly recommend that if you need to replace the catalytic converter that you replace it with an original manufacturer brand unit (i.e. get it from a dealership). Second choice would be a high-quality replacement part such as a 50-state legal cat. There are many stories in our forums where folks replaced the cat with a cheaper aftermarket one only to have the code return shortly thereafter.\nOne thing to note is that many vehicle manufacturers offer a longer warranty\non emissions-related parts. So if you have a newer car but it's out of it's\nbumper-to-bumper warranty, there still may be warranty on this type of problem.\nMany manufacturers give a five year, unlimited mileage warranty on these items.\nIt's worth checking into.\n\n"""

","b""\nCatalytic converters contain precious metals like platinum, palladium, rhodium among others. Basically, the cheaper the cat, the less precious metals used. It should be noted that there are some automobile makes that are very finicky when it comes to catalytic converters and the logic that the PCM uses to monitor them. Just because the parts guy says it will work doesn't mean that it will. The reason is that the engineering of the vehicle was done with a high quality catalyst in mind and it can't be replaced with a low cost catalyst. There are also different kinds of catalysts. Some makes will allow for a cheaper catalyst while others simply will not. Toyotas &amp; Subarus are the most notorious for this. Subarus require CARB certified catalysts to keep the check engine light off and won't tolerate an aftermarket catalyst, no matter how expensive.\nSo basically if you have a recurrence of this code after replacing the catalyst with an aftermarket catalyst, this may be your problem. If you have this code and haven't replaced the cat, there's basically two likely causes: The catalyst is no good, or the engine is running out of optimal air:fuel ratio. A tune up or engine repair may correct it. Otherwise you'll need to replace the catalyst.\n"""

To accurately test the system, you\'ll want to refer to a vehicle make/model specific diagnostic flow chart. \nCheck for other DTCs\nOxygen sensor codes can often be set because of engine performance problems that cause an out of balance air/fuel mixture. If there are other DTCs stored, you\'ll want to address those first before proceeding with oxygen sensor diagnosis.\nCheck Sensor Operation\nThis is best done using a scan tool, or better yet, an oscilloscope. Since most individuals don\'t have access to a scope, so we will cover oxygen sensor diagnosis using a scan tool. Connect the scan tool to the ODB port under the dash. Turn the scan tool on and choose the Bank 2 Sensor 1 voltage parameter from the data list. Bring the engine up to operating temperature and view the sensor operation on the scan tool in graph mode. The sensor should rapidly switch between rich and lean (0.1 volts and 0.9 volts). If the sensor response is sluggish, it is probably faulty and should be replaced.\nIf the sensor reads above 0.55 volts constantly, either the sensor has failed, the air/fuel mixture is too rich or there is an open in the sensor signal circuit. If the sensor reads above 0.35 volts constantly, either the sensor has failed, the air/fuel mixture is too lean or there is high resistance or a short in the signal wire to the PCM.\nCheck the circuit\nOxygen sensors produce their own voltage signal which is sent back to the PCM.

Autozone offers free online repair manuals for many vehicles and ALLDATADIY offers single vehicle subscriptions. To check for continuity between the sensor and PCM, turn the ignition key to the ""off"" position and disconnect the O2 sensor connector. Connect a digital multimeter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the O2 sensor signal terminal on the PCM and the signal wire. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired.

","b""\nCatalytic converters contain precious metals like platinum, palladium, rhodium among others. Basically, the cheaper the cat, the less precious metals used. It should be noted that there are some automobile makes that are very finicky when it comes to catalytic converters and the logic that the PCM uses to monitor them. Just because the parts guy says it will work doesn't mean that it will. The reason is that the engineering of the vehicle was done with a high quality catalyst in mind and it can't be replaced with a low cost catalyst. There are also different kinds of catalysts. Some makes will allow for a cheaper catalyst while others simply will not. Toyotas &amp; Subarus are the most notorious for this. Subarus require CARB certified catalysts to keep the check engine light off and won't tolerate an aftermarket catalyst, no matter how expensive.\nSo basically if you have a recurrence of this code after replacing the catalyst with an aftermarket catalyst, this may be your problem. If you have this code and haven't replaced the cat, there's basically two likely causes: The catalyst is no good, or the engine is running out of optimal air:fuel ratio. A tune up or engine repair may correct it. Otherwise you'll need to replace the catalyst.\n"""

","b'\nFor me, a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt ohmmeter (DVOM), an infrared thermometer (with a laser pointer), and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) will be required when diagnosing a code P0439.\nAny diesel exhaust fluid injection codes, ignition misfire codes, throttle position sensor codes, manifold air pressure codes, and mass air flow sensor codes should be addressed before attempting to diagnose a stored code P0439. The engine must be in good running order before diagnosing this code.\nI usually begin my diagnosis with a visual inspection of system wiring harnesses and connectors. I would focus my attention on harnesses that are routed near hot exhaust pipes and manifolds, as well as those that are routed near sharp edges like the ones found on exhaust shields.\nNext, I would connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all trouble codes and freeze frame data. I write this information down because it may come in handy if this proves to be an intermittent code. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if the P0439 is reset.\nIf applicable, make sure that the diesel exhaust fluid reservoir is filled with the correct fluid and that the injection system is functioning properly. If the diesel exhaust fluid injection system fails, the heated catalyst will not function efficiently and a code P0439 will be stored. If the diesel exhaust fluid injection system is not working properly, check system fuses and relays to make sure that the controller is operable.\nIf the diesel fluid injection system is functioning as designed, use the infrared thermometer to test input and output temps of the catalytic converter. Use the vehicle information source and compare the actual temperature data with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications. If the output temperature is not within specifications, suspect a defective catalytic converter.\nIf the output temperature of the heated catalyst meets specifications, use the DVOM to test the exhaust temperature sensor using the specifications found in the vehicle information source. Replace the exhaust temperature sensor if it fails to comply with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications.\nTest O2 sensors following manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n The code P0439 is frequently stored as a result of incorrect or insufficient diesel exhaust fluid\nDisconnect related controllers before probing circuits with the DVOM \n\n \n\n \n'"

","b""\nFuel pump senders normally last the life of the fuel pump. So if you have this code present, do a visual inspection of the fuel tank and wiring harness. Look for damage to the tank indicating impact that may have damaged the fuel pump or sender. Look for missing ground strap or a rusty ground where the fuel tank is grounded to the frame. Check for damage to the wiring harness connector. Repair as needed. Find out what kind of system you have and verify that voltage to the fuel level sensor is present at the fuel pump wiring harness. If not, repair the open or short in the wiring.\nDoing a voltage drop test on the ground circuit can determine if there is a high resistance path in the ground circuit. You can perform this by using a voltmeter and connecting one lead to the battery ground post and the other to the fuel level sensor ground at the tank. Turn the key on (preferably the engine should be running). Ideally it should be 100 millivolts or less (.1 volts). Anything close to 1 volt indicates a current problem or a developing problem. Repair/clean the fuel level sensor ground as needed. It's not impossible that the instrument cluster has failed internally or on the printed circuit board (if applicable). These are very difficult for the layman to test. But if you have access to a wiring diagram you may be able to remove the cluster and see the damaged circuit if it's located on the printed circuit board, but otherwise you'll need a scan tool that will communicate with the instrument cluster.\nA simple way to test the fuel level circuit is to provide a good ground to the fuel level sensor at the fuel tank connector. With the key on the fuel gauge should go to one extreme or the other. Removing the ground path completely should cause the gauge to do the opposite. If the gauge responds, you know the wiring that supplies voltage and ground to the fuel level sensor is good and that the instrument cluster is likely okay. The likely suspect would be the fuel level sensor itself. The fuel tank may need removal to gain access to the fuel pump module in the tank. A PCM or BCM (Body control module) failure isn't impossible but highly unlikely. Don't suspect this first.\n"""

","b'\nIt is always a wise idea to look up the technical service bulletins (TSB) on your particular vehicle to see what type complaints have been coming in to the dealer service department related to this code. Search using your favorite search engine ""technical service bulletins for ....."" Look up the code and the type of manufacturer recommended repair. This is also a good idea before buying a vehicle. \nMany vehicles will have two engine fans, one for engine cooling and the second for cooling the air conditioning condenser, and additional cooling for the engine. \nThe fan that is not in front of the air conditioning condenser is the main cooling fan and the one to concentrate on initially. Additionally, many vehicles have multi-speed fans requiring as many as three fan speed relays for low, medium and high. \nOpen the hood and do a visual inspection. Look at the fan and make sure there is no obstruction in front of the radiator blocking airflow. Spin the fan with your finger (make sure the vehicle and key is off). If it will not spin the fan bearings are shot and the fan is bad. \nCheck the electrical connection at the fan. Pull the connector apart and look for corrosion or bent pins. Repair if necessary and use dielectric grease on the terminals. \nOpen the fuse block and inspect the cooling fan relay fuses. If they are good pull the cooling fan relays out. The bottom of the fuse block lid will usually indicate placement, but if not, look in the owner\'s manual. \nThe vehicle\'s PCM\'s function is to act as a ground to operate components, not to supply power. The fan relays are nothing but a remote light switch. The fan as well as other apparatus draws too much amperage to be safe in the cockpit, so it\'s kept under the hood.\nA constant power supply from the battery is present on a terminal in each of the relays. This one turns on the fan when the circuit is closed. A switched terminal will be hot only when the key is on. The negative terminal in this circuit is the one used when the PCM wishes to active the relay by grounding it. \nLook at the circuit diagram displayed on the side of the relay. Look for the simple open and shut circuit. Verify the battery positive terminal in the relay block with constant power. The opposite side goes to the fan. Use a test light to find the hot terminal. \nJump the battery terminal to the fan harness terminal and the fan will operate. If not, disconnect the fan connection at the fan and using an ohmmeter check the continuity between the fan side of the relay terminal and the connector at the fan, If there is continuity the fan is bad. If not the harness between the fuse block and the fan is faulty. \nIf the fan operated, check the relays. Look at the side of the relay for the switched power terminal or just turn the key on. Check the terminals for an additional power terminal and look where it would be on the relay. \nJump the battery plus terminal in the first test with this switched terminal and place an additional jumper from the negative terminal on the relay to ground. The switch will click on.

The Cooling Fan Module (cooling fans) is usually found mounted behind the radiator in front of the engine. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P0483 returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, verify the integrity of the cooling system. Insure that the thermostat and the water pump are functioning properly. Once the engine has cooled, remove the radiator cap and insure that it will seal properly to the radiator. If there are any questions about these cooling system components, replace them first, as this is the most common area of concern related to this fault code. Once this is done, clear codes and test drive vehicle to insure the P0483 does not return. \nIf the code does return, we will need to test the fans and their associated circuits. Typically, there are 2 wires at each cooling fan in the module. First, disconnect the harness going to the cooling fan module. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), connect one lead of the meter to one terminal of one of the fans. Connect the remaining meter lead to the other fan terminal. It should not be open or shorted. Verify the resistance specifications for your particular vehicle. If the fan motor is either open or shorted (infinite resistance or no resistance/0 ohms), replace the cooling fan module or if available, the cooling fan motor. \nIf that test passes, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 12V to the cooling fan module power supply circuit (Red lead to the fan power supply circuit, black lead to a good ground). With a scan tool that can activate the cooling fans, turn on the cooling fans. If there is no 12 volts to the fan, repair the wiring from the PCM or relay to the fan, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at the cooling fan module. Connect a test light to 12V battery positive (red terminal) and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to the Cooling fan module circuit ground. Using the scan tool to actuate the cooling fan module, see if the test light comes on each time the scan tool actuates the fan. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to the fan to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf all tests have passed so far, and you continue to get a P0483 code, this would most likely indicate a failed cooling fan module, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the fan had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

","b""\nAll EGR valves have one thing in common-they re-circulate exhaust from the exhaust to the intake manifold. Other than that, they differ in their methods for regulating the opening of the pintle and sensing its position.\nThe following repair procedures represent the most common problems accounting for the majority of failures in the EGR system. Wiring harness or sensor failures require a service manual to determine the proper wire identification and diagnostic procedures. \nKeep in mind that the wiring differs between manufacturers and computers do not react well if the wrong wire is probed. If you probe the wrong wire and send excessive voltage through the computer's sensor input terminal and the computer will fry. \nAt the same time, if the wrong connector is disconnected the computer could lose its programming causing the vehicle to fail to start again until the dealer reprograms the computer. \n\nThe code P0486 indicates a &quot;B&quot; circuit malfunction, so check the EGR sensor connector for corrosion, bent or pushed out terminals or loose connection. Clean off any corrosion and re-seat the connector. \nRemove the electrical connector and remove the EGR. Check for coking in the EGRs intake and exhaust. Clean out any coking as necessary so the pintle will move up and down smoothly. \nCheck the vacuum line from the EGR to the solenoid and replace it if any defects are found.\nCheck the solenoid electrical connector for corrosion or defects. \nIf the vehicle is a Ford, follow the two vacuum hoses from the EGR to the differential pressure feedback EGR sensor (DPFE) in the rear of the manifold. \nCheck the two pressure hoses for corrosion. Experience dictates these hoses plug with carbon from the exhaust. Use a small pocket screwdriver or equivalent and clean the hoses of corrosion and the sensor will begin to operate again. \n\nIf the most common tests failed to solve the problem, a service manual is needed to continue to test the wiring circuits. The best solution is to take the vehicle to a service facility with the proper diagnostic equipment. They can quickly identify and repair this type of problem. \nRelated EGR codes: P0409\n \n\n \n"""

First thing, you will want to pop the hood and locate your radiator/fan assembly. Most times, it will be mounted towards the front of the vehicle, directly in front of the engine. Keep in mind that their are numerous different styles and setups for cooling fans, some are mounted directly on the radiator itself and some are belt driven by the engine so identify the style of your particular cooling fan. Once located, inspect the fan(s) and blades for damage. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to grab one of the fan blades and give it a light shake to check for any play in the bearings , depending on the style and how much play is present, you may need to replace the fan assembly . Make sure to also inspect the shroud and anything that may hinder the fans performance. Pay close attention to the wiring harness for the cooling fan. It only takes one lightly frayed wire to cause some codes to come on. If everything checks out, continue.\nTIP: Sometimes aftermarket shrouds do not fit perfect causing the fan to rub on parts of the shroud causing a low speed condition. Spin fan by hand with engine off and cold. Fan should spin freely in the shroud (may have to remove belt for the belt driven version).\nBasic Step #2\nCheck the connector. First, make sure the battery is disconnected before performing any repairs or tests on the electrical system. Follow the harness coming out of the cooling fan until you find its connector. Once located, inspect for overheating/melting or corrosion. Disconnect it and inspect the pins inside. Any corroded or bent pins must be repaired/replaced. Typically any damage to the connector means you will need to replace it. If all looks good, continue.\nTIP: Make sure you have a healthy electrical system. Always be aware that if you have a weak battery or a problem with your charging system, the ECM may be falsely illuminating the engine light among numerous other possibilities. \nBasic Tip #3\nCheck the relay.

First, make sure the battery is disconnected before performing any repairs or tests on the electrical system. Follow the harness coming out of the cooling fan until you find its connector. Once located, inspect for overheating/melting or corrosion. Disconnect it and inspect the pins inside. Any corroded or bent pins must be repaired/replaced. Typically any damage to the connector means you will need to replace it. If all looks good, continue.\nTIP: Make sure you have a healthy electrical system. Always be aware that if you have a weak battery or a problem with your charging system, the ECM may be falsely illuminating the engine light among numerous other possibilities. \nBasic Tip #3\nCheck the relay. Depending on your system, you may have a cooling fan relay that assists in controlling your fan. Refer to manufacturer for location. If the relay looks melted or burnt this may indicate a problem within the relay and should be replaced.\nTIP: It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to buy these types of relays at your manufacturers dealership as i have found some defective aftermarket relays that have caused some serious damage.\nBasic Step #4\nCheck your ECM or PCM. Locate your ECM. Location heavily depends on the make and model but you may find a ECM: under a seat, under the hood, in the trunk, mounted to the firewall, under the dash, in a fender or mounted to the floor somewhere. Once located, inspect for water damage or corrosion. this may indicate a problem. Qualified eyes would be needed beyond this point.\n \n\n \n'"

","b'\nThe most common fix for this DTC is to replace the purge solenoid valve. However, be sure to do a proper diagnosis before replacing parts!\nIdeally you would use an advanced scan tool, with the ignition on and engine off, you seal the EVAP system using the Seal/Purge function. Then, watch the fuel tank pressure sensor reading when you turn the purge off. If the pressure value is higher than the normal range set by the manufacturer, replace the EVAP canister purge solenoid valve. Refer to a model-specific repair guide for the proper specification.\n If you don\'t have access to the scan tool, you could always disconnect the vacuum line at the purge valve going back to the charcoal canister. Unplug the electrical connector on the purge valve, start the engine, then put your finger on the valve where you disconnected the line. If you can feel vacuum there, the purge solenoid valve is faulty and needs to be replaced. Alternately, you could simply remove the purge solenoid valve and blow into it. It is normally closed, so if air goes through then you need to replace it. \nIf the purge valve checks out good, either the problem with the valve is intermittent or there is a problem with the fuel tank pressure sensor. To test the fuel tank pressure sensor you will need to have a high end scan tool to monitor the tank pressure with the gas cap removed. If the sensor shows vacuum with the gas cap removed, there is a problem with the fuel tank pressure sensor.\nHere is a picture of one purge solenoid valve. Yours may look similar or different, consult a factory service guide or your local vehicle dealership for more details:\n<p align=""center""><img src=""/faq/images/evap-purge-valve-solenoid.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""218"" alt=""EVAP system purge valve solenoid"">\n'"

Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA suitable diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter, a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s service manual (or equivalent), and a smoke machine will help to diagnose code P0497. \nI have a habit of beginning my diagnosis with a visual inspection of all system wiring and connectors, as well as vacuum lines and hoses. Repair or replace damaged wiring and/or connectors as required. \nThe EVAP system is comprised of a network of long vacuum lines and metal tubing, so this can be a chore in itself. If you have access to a smoke machine, it can make this process much easier. Keep in mind that most of these vacuum circuits will have no vacuum present unless the purge control solenoid/valve is activated. Repair or replace defective vacuum lines and hoses as needed.\nIf charcoal is found in the vacuum lines, immediately suspect a defective canister. Compromised charcoal elements cannot usually be replaced individually and will probably demand complete canister replacement. Connect the scanner to the diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Write all this down so that you can come back to it later. Clear all codes and test drive the vehicle. Keep in mind that it may take several ignition cycles for this type of code to be reset. If it resets, continue with your diagnosis. \nConsult the service manual for particular system specifications and test EVAP purge solenoid/valve operation. Use the scanner to activate the purge control solenoid and physically check vacuum flow with the engine running and the purge control solenoid activated. \nIf the solenoid fails to open when activated, check system voltage and ground signals as compared to manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specs. If voltage and ground signals are present, suspect a defective solenoid. Test the purge control solenoid (with the DVOM) using the service manual as a guide. If voltage and ground signals are absent, disconnect system controllers and test system circuits with the DVOM. Repair or replace open or shorted circuits as necessary.\nIf all system circuits and components comply with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Poor running engines may not provide sufficient vacuum for EVAP purge operation \n A loose or missing fuel cap will not cause this code to be stored \n To use the smoke machine effectively, remove vacuum lines from the canister and plug them before applying smoke \n\n'"

Too Low or low a value indicates a faulty coil inside the valve, thusly meaning replacement is necessary. This code seems to be prevalent on Dodge, Chrsyler, and Jeep products. In those cases the vent valve was bad. With GM products (specifically pickups), GM has released a new updated valve assembly.\nFinally, remove the valve, you may be able to access the pintle inside and it simply could just be sticking from fuel residue.

The brake light switch is mounted on a cross-beam support brace directly behind the brake pedal mounting bracket. The only method to access the switch is to move the front seat rearward, lay on your back, and look up under the dash. You will see a bracket housing a switch near the top of the brake pedal arm. The switch will have four or six wires.\nThe switch rests in the bracket so that its activating rod is in contact with the brake pedal arm when the pedal is fully extended. At this point the switch is depressed by the brake pedal arm cutting off the current. When the brake pedal is depressed, the arm extends turning the switch on and activating the brake lights. When the pedal is released, the arm again depresses the rod turning off the brake lights.\nDiagnostic Steps\n\nHave a helper check the brake lights. Make sure they operate by cycling them on and off and that the bulbs are good.\nIf the brake lights are on continuously the brake light switch is either improperly adjusted or faulty. The same applies if they fail to operate. Move the driver\'s seat back and look under the dash. Squeeze the tabs on the electrical connector located on the brake light switch and pull off the connector.\nWith the voltmeter check the voltage on the red wire in the connector. Place the black lead on any good ground and the red lead into the red wire terminal. You should have 12 volts, if not check the wiring to the fuse block.\nPlug the connector into the switch and backprobe the white wire with the pedal depressed. You should have 12 volts with the pedal depressed and no voltage with the pedal extended. If there is no voltage replace the brake light switch. If voltage exists at the white wire with the pedal extended replace the switch.\nIf the switch is of the adjustable category, check the adjustment. The switch must be in good contact with the pedal arm and fully depressed.\nIf the brake lights function properly yet you still have the code, heck the remaining wires on the brake light switch. Remove the connector and probe the remaining wires for power. Make note of the location of the power wire and replace the connector. Back robe the wire adjacent to the power wire with the pedal depressed. If there is no power replace the switch.\nIf the last test had power as the pedal was depressed the switch is good. The problem exists in the wiring to the computer or with the computer itself.\nLocate the computer and back probe STP terminal on the computer to ground. If 12 volts is displayed on the voltmeter the computer is bad. If there was little or no voltage replace or repair the harness from the computer to the switch.\n\nAdditional Notes\nPlease be aware that some vehicles are equipped with driver side knee airbags.

","b""\nThis should be a fairly straightforward diagnosis. Start by clearing the fault codes. Then unplug the IAC and start the engine (This may cause other IAC codes to set. Just ignore them for now). If the P0505 code doesn't reset, replace the IAC. It is internally shorting one of the IAC circuits. If the code DOES return after unplugging the IAC and starting the engine, then you know it isn't the IAC motor. Visually check the wiring harness all the way back to the PCM. You may need to visually inspect the harness by removing all the insulation off the wires. It is possible that the wires could be shorting to eachother or to other wires in the harness. \nIf there are no wiring problems, and the code keeps returning with the IAC unplugged, you can check the PCM by removing the IAC wires from the PCM connector (or clipping the wires in a location where they can be repaired easily) and then start the engine (If you're not sure, don't do it. Take it to a qualified professional). Now if the code doesn't reset there is a problem with the wiring. Check for continuity on all the IAC wires. Any resistance points to a problem. Check for voltage on any(At this point there shouldn't be any voltages on the wires because they're clipped at one end and unplugged at the IAC). Repair as necessary. But if the P0505 code DOES reset after removing the IAC wires from the PCM connector (or clipping them), replace the PCM, there's a problem internally on the IAC control circuit. \nOther related DTCs: P0507\n"""

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen diagnosing a P0512, a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) will be necessary.\nBegin with a visual inspection of all related wiring and connectors. This is also a good time to check all fuses, using the DVOM. Check starter system fuses while the starter is being engaged because fuses on unloaded circuits may appear operational until the circuit is loaded. \nYou must now determine whether or not the vehicle in question is equipped with a starter relay. If it is; a simple and easy test is to swap the starter relay with a known good relay. Since most manufacturers use identical relays for multiple functions, you may swap one relay for another for diagnostic purposes. If the problem is rectified, after the relays are swapped, swap them back and replace the starter relay with a new one.\nTo test the relay without swapping relays, look in your vehicle information source and find the starter system wiring diagram. The starter relay connector view will also prove helpful. Test for a battery voltage input circuit to the starter relay. This circuit should maintain battery voltage when the ignition switch is placed in the on position (this is called switched voltage). If there is no voltage being input to the starter relay, check system fuses, fusible links and wiring from the battery or battery junction box. In most cases, the ignition switch will provide the relay with a secondary voltage source signal when the ignition switch is turned to the start position. At the same time, the PCM will provide a ground signal to the starter relay. The secondary voltage and ground signals will cause contacts inside the relay to close, completing the starter request circuit that should send a signal to the starter solenoid and back to the PCM. \nDisconnect all related controllers before testing circuit resistance with the DVOM. Test the voltage signal to the relay (from the ignition switch) first. If it is not present, suspect a defective ignition switch or wiring malfunction. If the secondary voltage input is present, check the ground signal input from the PCM. If there is no ground being input to the starter relay from the PCM, suspect PCM failure or a PCM programming error. \nThere could also be a wiring malfunction between the PCM and the starter relay. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n This code will seldom be exhibited in a vehicle without a starter relay (I have never seen it) \n To avoid misdiagnosis, after repairs are performed and the code is cleared, operate the vehicle normally until the PCM either enters readiness mode or the code is reset \n Before swapping relays (for diagnostic purposes) make sure that they have matching service numbers \n Always swap relays back to their original position and replace the defective relay with a new one\n\n'"

","b'\nYou will need a diagnostic scanner and a reputable vehicle information source in order to diagnose a code P0513.\nBegin with a visual inspection of related wiring and connectors as well as the key/fob in question. If the key/fob housing has been cracked or damaged in any way, there is a great chance that the circuit board is also damaged. This (or weak battery issues) could be the source of your problems as they relate to a stored code P0513.\nConsult your vehicle information source for technical service bulletins (TSB) that pertain to the particular symptoms that you are experiencing with the vehicle in question. The TSB should also cover a code P0513. The TSB database is built from many thousands of repair experiences. If you can locate the proper TSB, the information found therein may help in your individual diagnosis.\nI would also contact the local car dealership (or use the NHTSA website) to see if there are any related safety recalls for my vehicle. If there are current NHTSA safety recalls, the dealership would have to repair the condition free of charge. This could save me some time and money if the recall proves to be pertinent to the malfunction that has caused the P0513 to be stored in my vehicle.\nNow I would connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all trouble codes and freeze frame data. I would write the information down on paper in case I need it later. This will also help as you begin diagnosing codes in the order in which they have been stored. Before clearing the codes, consult your vehicle diagnostic source for the correct security reset and key/fob relearn procedure.\nRegardless of the security reset and key/fob relearn procedure, the P0513 (and all other related codes) will probably need to be cleared prior to performing it. After the reset/relearn procedure has been completed, use the scanner to observe security and microprocessor key/fob data. The scanner should reflect key/fob status and certain scanners (Snap On, OTC, etc.) will even yield helpful troubleshooting steps.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Most of the time, this type of code is caused by a key/fob malfunction \n If your key/fob requires battery power, suspect that the battery has failed \n If the vehicle has been involved in an attempted theft, you may be able to reset the security system (including clearing the code) to rectify the situation \n\n'"

Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P0514 code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0514 code does return, we will need to test the BTS sensor and its associated circuits. With the Key Off, disconnect the electrical connector at the BTS sensor. Connect a Digital Voltmeter black lead to the ground terminal at the BTS sensor wiring harness connector. Connect the red lead of the Digital Voltmeter to the signal terminal at the BTS sensor wiring harness connector. Turn Key On Engine Off. Check manufacturer's specifications; voltmeter should read 5 volts. If not, repair the signal or ground wire, or replace the PCM. \nIf the prior test passed and you continue to get a P0514, this would most likely indicate a failed BTS sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the BTS sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle to be installed correctly.\n \n\n \n"""

If the engine has not received oil changes using the proper viscosity oil and at regular intervals the likelihood increases that the problem could be worn internal components (i.e. physically low oil pressure). Correct any issues found.\n\nIdeally the next step here would be to use a mechanical oil pressure gauge to test the actual oil pressure in the engine. As a DIYer though you might want to go to the next step and check all the wiring and sensor first if you don't have access to that gauge. You should still locate a gauge and test the actual pressure though.

","b""\nThe first step in the troubleshooting process for any malfunction is to research the Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) for known issues with the specific vehicle.\nAdvanced diagnostic steps become very vehicle specific and may require the appropriate advanced equipment and knowledge to perform accurately. We include basic steps below but refer to a vehicle year/make/model/powertrain specific repair guide for specific steps for your vehicle.\nBasic Step #1\nGenerally speaking, cruise control servos are mounted in the engine compartment somewhere. Most times, they are in close proximity to the throttle body, after all they do control vehicle speed using this. Once located, do a general visual inspection. Look at the cable, check for fraying, kinks, corrosion or any signs of malfunctioning. If the servo cable does not move freely when controlling the throttle, the ECM could interpret it as a performance issue.\nHow does the servo look? These are usually vacuum controlled, so its physical condition could indicate a problem. It's important to check all the vacuum lines running to the servo itself. Any cracked or deteriorated lines should be taken as a sign of your vacuum system's health so I recommend replacing all of the vacuum lines involved as they are inexpensive and could save you problems in the future. \nBasic Step #2\nOn to the electrical side of things, verify the connector on the servo. Any broken tabs or loose connections should be repaired. The harness may be running through tight areas and/or moving parts, so be aware of any chafing areas that could cause an issue and repair any broken/ damaged wires.\nBasic Step #3\nDepending on your OBD2 scan tool's capabilities, you can potentially monitor the servo's operation with it connected to the vehicle. Sometimes you may be given percentages or maybe electrical values. Either way you can compare the values to its physical operation by watching it under the hood, with the wheels off the ground. This is an old procedure and may cause issues especially when talking about more modern vehicles. That said always ensure any diagnosing/ repair procedures are also recommended by your vehicle's manufacturer. If you neglect to do your research here, you could easily damage other vehicle components.\n"""

Freon under high pressure can be dangerous in quite a number of ways and the a/c system can be damaged if the correct amount of freon is not used. Before beginning your diagnosis, the a/c system must be filled to the correct level with the appropriate (amount and type) freon and oil. If charging specifications are not visible in the underhood area, check a reliable source of vehicle information. A set of automotive a/c gauges, a vacuum pump, and some type of an oil dispenser will be required to service the a/c system. If the system has a small leak, an ultraviolet leak detection dye injection is also recommended. This will help you diagnose a leak if the freon leaks out again.\nOnce the a/c system has been serviced and is full of freon, it may be necessary to clear the code before power can be restored to the a/c compressor clutch coil. Connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Write all this down before clearing the codes. With the a/c system full of freon, operate it and see if the P0534 is reset.\nIf the code is reset, use a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM) to check the low pressure cutoff switch. This can be done by starting the engine and turning the a/c on max with the fan on high. Use caution when working around moving parts and connect the negative test lead of the DVOM to a known good ground. Use the positive test lead to probe the wires of the low pressure switch connector. This will be carried out with the low pressure cutoff switch connector plugged in. All wires (usually three) should have battery voltage..\nHere are several possible scenarios:\nNone of the circuits have voltage\n\nCheck system fuses with the DVOM\nCheck the a/c on/off switch\nCheck the low pressure switch connector\nCheck the a/c compressor relay\n\nOne of the circuits has voltage; the others do not\n\nThe low pressure switch may be defective\nJumper the switch and see if the compressor clutch is activated\nIf the clutch is activated with the connector jumped, the low pressure cutoff switch is bad\n\n\nLow freon conditions are the leading cause of a P0534 being stored. Make sure that the a/c system is full of freon before diagnosing this code\n\n'"

","b'\nBe sure to check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your vehicle. Getting access to a known fix can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nBasic Step #1\nLocate and visually inspect the A/C evaporator temperature sensor. Generally speaking the evaporator core is located inside the HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) air box. The A/C Evaporator Temperature sensor is typically mounted to the evaporator itself or very near it. You may be able to gain access by looking under the dash fairly easily. It may also be possible that you will need to remove numerous plastic panels and/or the radio so always refer to your service manual for the specific location. Keep an eye out for any signs of overheating and/ or corrosion on the sensor itself. This may indicative of your problem. If found defective, replace the sensor.\nTIP: Make sure that your interior is at a reasonable temperature. Start prying on cold plastic and it will break so be careful.\nBasic Step #2\nTest the temperature sensor. Most times, these sensors are a resistor type sensor. In other words, the resistance within the sensor changes in direct relation to the temperature. Understanding how this works probably gives you some idea on how to diagnose the sensor itself. Usually, the manufacturer will have a desired resistance at certain temperatures. Using your multimeter you can record the resistance within the sensor and compare it to the desired values specified by your manufacturer. If an open is present, you may have an internal resistance within the sensor itself and will need to be replaced.\nNOTE: Your manufacturer may have a specific diagnostic strategy depending on which type of sensor, make, model, etc. so always refer to your service manual. If uncomfortable with electrical testing and/or working around refrigeration systems for that matter, bring your vehicle to a reputable shop.\nBasic Step #3\nCheck the wiring. Given the location of the evaporator temperature sensor, it may be easy to locate and follow the harness to check for any obvious signs of damage. Especially around where the driver and passengers feet may interfere with the wiring (if possible).\n'"

","b""\nBe sure to check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your vehicle. Getting access to a known fix can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nTools\nSome of the things you may need when diagnosing or repairing the power steering circuits and systems:\n\nOBD code reader\nPower steering fluid\nDrain pan\nMultimeter\nBasic socket set\nBasic ratchet and wrench sets\nBasic screwdriver set\nBattery terminal cleaner\nService manual\n\nSafety Tips\n\n Let engine cool\nChalk wheels\nWear PPE (Personal protective equipment)\n\nNOTE: ALWAYS verify and record the integrity of your battery and charging system before further troubleshooting.\nBasic Step #1\nAlways keep it simple at first. Check your power steering fluid level and top up as necessary. Check your parking space, any signs of a leak? If so, investigate further. If the fluid is low, it's going somewhere so make sure to repair any mechanical leaks before proceeding to any electrical diagnosing. Take a good look at the sensor itself, I've personally seen these sensors leak through the sensor itself, so make sure it's dry and there is no obvious signs of damage and/or leaks.\nNOTE: These systems use high pressures that could cause harm so be careful, pinhole leaks are dangerous and are a serious hazard. If you are not familiar with the dangers of working with hydraulic systems, please bring your vehicle to a reputable repair facility.\nBasic Step #2\nTo rule out the sensor, you will need to test it.

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nThe most common cause for this code is low battery voltage/a battery that was disconnected/charging system malfunction (faulty alternator). While we are on the subject, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget to check the most neglected part of the charging system, the alternator belt!\nFirst, check the charging system. Start the vehicle. Turn the headlights on and blower fan to High speed to load the electrical system. Using a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), check voltage at the battery. It should be between 13.2 volts and 14.7 volts. If the voltage is well below 12 volts or above 15.5 volts, diagnose the charging system, with the main emphasis being on the alternator. If unsure, have the battery, starting and charging system tested at a local parts store / auto repair shop. Most will perform this service for a small charge, if not for free, and will usually give you a printout of the test results. \nIf the voltage was correct, and you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, more than likely this code is either intermittent or is a history/memory code and no further diagnosis is required.\nIf the P0560 code does return, locate the PCM on your particular vehicle. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nNext, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory with the scan tool, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0560 code does return, we will need to check the voltages to the PCM. First, disconnect the negative battery cable at the battery. Next, disconnect the harness going to the PCM. Reconnect the battery cable. Turn the ignition switch on. With a DVOM, test the PCM ignition feed circuit (Red lead to the PCM ignition feed circuit, black lead to a good ground). If there is less than battery volts on this circuit, repair the wiring from the PCM to the ignition switch. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at the PCM. Connect a test light to 12V battery positive (red terminal) and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to the PCM ignition feed circuit ground. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to the PCM to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0560, this would most likely indicate a failed PCM. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

","b'\nBasic Step #1\nOnce your vehicle\'s Multi-function/Cruise control switch is located, visually inspect it for any kind of contamination. It is very easy for plastic buttons/switches to get dirty/greasy/sticky causing them to malfunction and/or operate abnormally. Make sure that the mechanical operation of the switch is seamless and smooth. Any problem here should be addressed immediately. If your particular scan tool/OBD reader has the capabilities, feel free to observe the electronic operation of the switch through DATA STREAM (the mode name here varies between readers but the important part is to find a mode to observe data real-time).\nTIP: Be sure to avoid spraying any cleaning solutions directly to the button. Lightly dampen a clean rag with either water, soap &amp; water, dash cleaner, etc. and carefully remove the debris from the switch\'s crevices. An air powered blow gun will aid in removing debris without worsening the situation.\nBasic Step #2\nTo access the connectors and harnesses involved within the cruise control/multi-function switch input circuit, you may need to remove some dash plastic/shrouds. Be delicate whenever working with plastic. comfortable room temperatures always help with the ease of dash/interior plastic disassembly/assembly.\n If you can easily access the connector, you may be able to apply specific troubleshooting steps provided by your service manual. Switch testing will most likely involve recording electrical values using your multimeter. This may include operating the switch while recording and/or static testing. Refer to the specific make and model\'s service manual for ""diagnostic flow chart"".\nBasic Step #3\nA problem within the ECM is, most times, the last resort in diagnosis. Given the fact that it may be one of the most expensive electronic repairs you could do on your vehicle, leave this to the professionals.\n'"

Sometimes, buttons are missing, cola has stuck the button in one position, buttons are loose and not making proper electrical connections. That all said, make sure that the buttons, that control the cruise functions, are freely moving and not contaminated with potentially damaging particles and/or dirt. You will also want to record ALL of the cruise functions' malfunctions or abnormalities.\nBasic Step #2\nDoes the cruise control light come on in the instrument cluster when cruise is manually activated? If not, you may want to verify if there is a fuse for the circuit. This information should be found in the make and model's service manual. Replace any blown fuses with new and manufacturer-approved ones.\nBasic Step #3\nTo access the harness to the cruise control switch/module, generally speaking, you will need to remove some dash parts (i.e. steering column shroud, airbag module in steering wheel, etc.). To pinpoint the specific wire involved in the fault, you will definitely be needing a proper wiring harness for your vehicle. These vary significantly, given many reasons. Always acquire proper service information BEFORE executing anything too invasive.\nBasic Step #4\nIt is a good idea to make sure your ABS (anti-lock brakes) system is in good working order and no ABS light on in the dash. ABS uses numerous sensors including speed sensors that, if malfunctioning, could fool the computers into thinking the vehicle is going faster or slower than the actual speed.\n"""

Record this information as it may prove useful as your diagnosis unfolds. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle normally until the PCM either enters readiness mode or the P0585 is reset. If the former occurs, you have an intermittent condition and it may need to worsen before a successful diagnosis can be reached. If the code is reset, continue with your diagnosis.\nUsing your source of vehicle information, obtain component testing procedures and specifications, diagnostic flow charts, connector face views, wiring diagrams, and connector pin-out charts. These items will be necessary to diagnose most codes.\nSearch for applicable technical service bulletins (TSB). If you locate an entry which mirrors the vehicle in question, as well as the code/s stored and the symptoms exhibited, it will likely help you to diagnose the P0585.\nCheck voltage (usually comparable to battery voltage) and ground circuits at the multi-function switch using the DVOM. If no voltage is discovered, use the positive test lead of the DVOM to probe system fuses while grounding the negative test lead to a chassis ground.\nFuses should be tested with the circuit loaded to avoid a false result. If there is no ground, you may create a new one for testing purposes, then locate the appropriate ground junction to make sure it is secure. <br>\nIf voltage and ground are both present, use the DVOM to test the multi-function switch following manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s testing recommendations. Disconnect the switch before testing with the DVOM.

We include basic steps below but refer to a vehicle year/make/model/powertrain specific repair guide for specific steps for your vehicle.\nBasic Step #1\nTo solve the P0586, one of the most common solutions is to replace the cruise control switch so I will elaborate on this one. However, before proceeding with this fix, it's important that you are sure the switch is in need of a replacement. If you're certain that the switch is faulty, by following diagnostic steps in your service manual, you can start by locating your car's battery and disconnecting it. Then, remove the steering wheel column bolt covers using a screwdriver or ratchet if necessary.\nYou may have to carefully remove the centre air bag cluster from the centre of the steering wheel by unbolting it from the back of the steering wheel. Then, detach the electrical connector connected to the air bag cluster by pressing the side clips and pulling them from the hard plastic side areas. Removing your steering wheel to access the switch may be necessary, in which a special puller may be required.\nNOTE: Always refer to service manual for proper steering wheel/AIR BAG removal procedures unique to your vehicle!\nOnce the electrical connector has been detached from the cruise control switch, detach the switch by removing the bolts that are holding the switch onto the steering column bracket. Replace the old cruise control switch with the new one and reinstall everything in the opposite order. Reconnect the battery and test drive your vehicle, make sure the traffic isn't too bad when testing your cruise control to keep safety in mind here.\nBasic Step #2\nAnother common problem when it comes to this code, is a mechanical issue present in the cruise control's vacuum system. This could mean physical damage to the cruise control vacuum solenoid itself, a vacuum leak in the system, kinked or obstructed line, etc. All these mechanical problems are generally easy to spot while first inspecting, once you've identified all the components involved within the system.\nRepair or replace any vacuum leaks immediatelly as they can produce more issues down the road if left unattended.

","b'\nDiagnosing a code P0602 can be challenging, even to the most experienced and well equipped technician. Nevertheless, there are a few preliminary tests that can be performed before throwing your hands in the air and passing the problem off to someone else.\nAs usual, I would begin my diagnosis with a visual inspection of engine management wiring harnesses and connectors. Any wiring and connectors that have been damaged or burned should be repaired or replaced. Next, I would connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Before clearing the codes, I would write them down just in case this proves to be an intermittent code. A code P0602 must be diagnosed and repaired before diagnosing and repairing any other stored codes, as other stored codes are likely to be false. Now clear the codes in the hope that the P0602 has been stored in error.\nIf the P0602 is immediately reset, check for battery voltage to the PCM. The PCM requires battery voltage to function properly. If the battery terminals are corroded or loose, there may be inadequate voltage reaching the PCM. Check PCM relays and fuses for battery voltage with the circuit loaded. Corroded fuses may appear normal until a load is applied to the circuit and their deficiency is revealed.\nObviously, if the PCM has been recently replaced, the likelihood that it was improperly programmed or not programmed at all is great. Also, a controller from another vehicle cannot be used unless it has been reprogrammed specifically for the vehicle in question and aftermarket (high-performance) programmers may not be recognized by other controllers (especially at first), causing a P0602 to be stored. \nIncorrectly programmed or replaced controllers may be reprogrammed with a factory scanner. If you cannot gain access to such a scanner, most dealerships offer PCM programming for a nominal fee. Some aftermarket PCM manufacturers offer preprogrammed controllers for certain models. Check your auto parts supplier and have the vehicle identification number, mileage, and other pertinent data available.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nNew or used, a replacement PCM will need to be programmed to match the vehicle in question\nAftermarket or high-performance programmers will frequently require time for other controllers to recognize them - if they ever do\n\n'"

","b'\nThis is quite a difficult problem to isolate. In my experience it has been both a wire issue and a PCM issue. It could be interference from a component that fried the PCM.\nInspect the battery cables. It may be as simply as a highly corroded terminal or loose connection. Also check all grounds and fuse box and PCM connections.\nCheck the charging system. Run the car with the alternator disconnected. There may be interference coming from the alternator. Does the code come back with the alternator disconnected?\nInspect wire harnesses that run close to the ignition system. Interference from these components may be being &quot;thrown&quot; into the circuit. Also check spark plug wires, coil for cracks or anywhere where ignition voltage can &quot;leak&quot;.\nUsing a voltmeter find the power supply circuits to the PCM. Monitor voltages while wiggling, bending, shaking the harness all around the engine and fuse boxes.\nIn many vehicles the PCM is located in a secluded spot. Meaning there&rsquo;s a chance that water may have gotten into the PCM case. Also a chance for vibration transfer. If no faults are found there may be an issue with the PCM itself.\nFinally, if your vehicle has an aftermarket chip or program in the vehicle, this may be the issue. Also, many manufacturers constantly update the software that is available for your computer, the code may be corrected with a reflash.\n \n\n \n'"

The RAM requires a minimum of 12.5-volts to function properly. Battery terminals that are corroded or loose could mean that there is inadequate voltage reaching the RAM. Test PCM fuses for battery voltage with the circuit loaded. Corroded fuses may appear normal until a load is applied to the circuit and then their deficiency will be discovered.\nIf the PCM has not been programmed properly the RAM will not function or may not be recognized. If the PCM for the vehicle in question has been recently replaced, it may have been improperly programmed or not programmed at all.

","b'\nPedal position sensor - The pedal position sensor is located on the gas pedal. There are usually three wires used to determine the pedal position, a 5 volt reference supplied by the PCM/ECM, ground, and sensor signal. A factory wiring diagram will be necessary to determine which wire is used. Make sure the connection is secure and there are no loose wires in the harness. Check for good ground using a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) set to the ohms scale by connecting one lead to the ground at the sensor connector and the other to chassis ground - resistance should be very low. Check for 5 volts reference voltage from the PCM by using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive lead at the wiring harness connector and the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the run or on position.\nCheck for reference voltage using the DVOM set to volts scale with the red lead on the reference signal and the negative lead on a good known ground with the key in the run / on position - the signal voltage should increase as the gas pedal is pushed down further. Typically the voltage ranges between 0.5 volts with the pedal not pressed and 4.5 volts at wide open throttle position. It may be necessary to check the signal voltage at the PCM as well to determine if there is a voltage difference between the sensor and what the PCM is reading. The position sensor signal should also be checked with a graphing multimeter or oscilloscope to determine if the voltage increases smoothly with no dropouts throughout the entire range of motion. If an advanced scan tool is available, the positions sensor is usually displayed as a percentage of desired throttle input, make sure the desired value is similar to the actual pedal position.\nThrottle position sensor - The throttle position sensor monitors the actual position of the throttle body blade. The throttle position sensor is located on the throttle body.

If an advanced scan tool is available, the positions sensor is usually displayed as a percentage of actual throttle position, make sure the desired position value is similar to the commanded position value.\nThrottle actuator motor - The PCM/ECM will send a signal to the throttle actuator motor based on the pedal position input and a predetermined output value depending on operating conditions. The pedal position is known as the desired input because the PCM/ECM controls the throttle blade position and may limit its performance under certain conditions. Most actuator motors are duty cycle controlled. Check the throttle actuator motor for correct resistance by unplugging the harness connector using the DVOM set to the ohms scale with the positive and negative lead on either end of the motor terminals. The resistance should be within factory specifications, if it is too high or low, the motor may not move to the commanded position.\nCheck the wiring by testing for power using a factory wiring diagram to locate the proper wires. The power feed wire can be checked using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive lead on the power wire and the negative lead on a known good ground. Voltage should be close to battery voltage with the key on in the run or on position, if there is a significant power loss, the wiring may be suspect and should be traced back to determine where the voltage drop is occurring. The signal wire is grounded through the PCM and turned on and off by a transistor. The duty cycle can be checked with a graphing multimeter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle function with the positive lead spliced into the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground - a standard volt meter will only display an average voltage which may be harder to determine if there are any dropouts in voltage over time. The duty cycle should match the percentage commanded by the PCM/ECM. It may be necessary to check the commanded duty cycle from the PCM/ECM using an advanced scan tool.\nThrottle body - Remove the throttle body and check for any obstructions or accumulation of dirt or grease around the throttle blade that would prevent normal movement. A dirty throttle blade may cause the throttle blade to not respond correctly when commanded to a certain position by the PCM/ECM.\nPCM/ECM - After checking all other functions at the sensors and motor, the PCM/ECM can be checked for desired input, actual throttle position and commanded motor position using an advanced scan tool that will display the input and output as a percentage. If the values do not match the actual numbers obtained from the sensors and motor, there may be excessive resistance in the wiring. The wiring can be checked by unplugging the sensor harness and the PCM/ECM harness using the DVOM set to ohms scale with the positive lead and negative lead on either end of the harness.\nIt will be necessary to use a factory wiring diagram to locate the proper wires for each of the components. If the wiring has excessive resistance, the numbers displayed by the PCM/ECM may not match the desired input, target output and actual output and the fault code will set.\n \n\n \n'"

I also like to make a note of any pertinent freeze frame data. This information can be very helpful if the malfunction in question should prove to be intermittent. \nBeginning at the power relay (for the PCM), make sure that there is battery voltage to the primary input terminal. Consult the wiring diagram, connector view, or pin-out chart from the service manual (or equivalent) for the location of each individual terminal. If there is no voltage, suspect a fault connection at a fuse or fusible link.\nNext, test the secondary input terminal.

Look for corroded, bent or pushed out (missing) pins in the sensor. Check the connector on the harness for the same thing, but in this case there are female ends that must be in place. The harness connector can be replaced separately if it can\'t be saved with cleaning or straightening the female connectors. Place a small amount of dielectric grease in the connector before reconnecting\nLook at the wiring harness location and make sure it\'s not rubbing on the shift linkage.

","b'\nThere are two possible conditions that will cause this code to set: \nCondition #1-The PCM detects drive or reverse at vehicle start-up \nCondition #2-The PCM detects park or neutral and the following conditions exist for 10 seconds or more: &gt;Throttle position is 5% or more: &gt;engine torque is greater than 50ft.lbs. &gt;Vehicle speed is greater than 20 MPH \nIn my experience this code is most common on four wheel drive trucks that have been out &quot;4-wheelin&quot; and have had damage inflicted to the range sensor and/or harness. It would be very rare to have a faulty PCM be the cause of this code. diagnosis of this code is pretty straight forward. SET THE PARKING BRAKE.\n Begin with a thorough visual inspection of the range sensor and wiring harness. Repair any damage found. Does the vehicle start in reverse/drive? If it does start, unplug the range sensor and try and start it in reverse/drive again. If it still starts, suspect a short in the harness. If it does not start, suspect a faulty or misadjusted range sensor.\nRelated Transmission Range Sensor codes: P0709.\n \n\n \n'"

","b'\nTo diagnose this code we must first have as a basic understanding of two things: \n1. What is an Open Circuit? \nAn open circuit is a circuit that does not make a complete loop from battery negative to battery positive. For example, when a light bulb stops working because the filament broke in half, the circuit would be open at the broken filament.\n2. What is a short circuit? \nA short circuit is when batter negative comes in contact with battery positive without some type of load in between the two. In other words there has to be a component (i.e. a light, a motor, a sensor, ect.) in the circuit. A short circuit is like dropping a wrench on top of your car battery and it touches both terminals and makes sparks. That is called a direct short.\nNow with simple circuit 101 out of the way refer to the diagram below. An open circuit at point A, B or C would cause low voltage to the PCM. A short circuit at the same points would cause a blown fuse and again low voltage at the PCM. Both of these conditions will set DTC P0707.\nTo verify the exact cause of the DTC simply check for voltage at point A, B and C. If there is voltage at A and B but not at C suspect a faulty range sensor. If there is voltage at C suspect shorted wiring or in my Experience, upon rare occasion, a faulty PCM. If there is voltage at A only check the fuses.\n\nRelated Transmission Range Sensor codes: P0709.\n'"

","b'\nThe transmission range sensor receives a twelve volt signal from the ignition switch and sends a signal back to the PCM/TCM that is appropriate for the selected position of the gear shifter. \nIn my experience the most common causes of this code have been a faulty range sensor or misadjusted shift cable/linkage. \nChecking this circuit is easiest with a scan tool but if one is not available there are still a few things you can check. Have the key in the on position with engine off. (KOEO) With a digital volt ohm meter you can check each return signal circuit individually by back probing at the sensor with it still connected. Have an assistant shift to each gear one at a time. Each signal circuit should have voltage in one position and one position only. If there is voltage present on any one circuit in more than one gear position suspect a faulty range sensor. \nIn my experience I have NEVER seen a PCM/TCM be the cause of any range sensor related DTC. This does not mean it is not possible, because it is, it is just not probable. However, I have seen a faulty PCM/TCM that was damaged by a short circuit in a range sensor. If you suspect a fault in the PCM/TCM make sure to look for the cause of the damage before installing a new one to avoid causing the same damage to it. \nRelated Transmission Range Sensor codes: P0709.\n'"

","b'\nThe transmission range sensor receives a 12 volt signal from the ignition switch then it sends a 12 volt signal, on the appropriate circuit according gear position, to the PCM/TCM. \nP0709 set when the signal is missing at the PCM/TCM. A scan tool that has the ability to read live data is the most accurate way to diagnose this DTC, but if one is not available here are a couple of things that can be checked with a digital volt ohm meter. (DVOM) In my experience the most common cause of intermittent signal issues are wiring related. \nIn this case, a close visual inspection of the range sensor wiring harness and the internal contacts of the range sensor connector should be performed first and thoroughly. If anything is found suspect during the inspection, repair the issue, clear the codes and test drive the vehicle. If the DTC returns, set the DVOM to volts and back probe the appropriate circuits at the PCM/TCM and \xe2\x80\x9cwiggle\xe2\x80\x9d the harness at and leading to the range sensor.

Remove the OSS sensor from the end of the transmission and check the condition of the gear to determine if the teeth are missing or worn and replace the gear if necessary. Check the wiring harness for any possible signs of damaged wiring, or loose connections. Check the resistance of the OSS by removing the harness connector and using a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM) set to the ohms scale, with either lead on each of the terminal connectors. Resistance should be within specification determined by the factory shop manual.\nIf the resistance is out of range or over limit (OL), replace the sensor. Check for power going into the sensor, and at the PCM harness connector using a factory wiring diagram as reference. If the OSS sensor is inline with the TFT sensor, the voltage will vary based on the temperature of the transmission fluid. Using a graphing volt meter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle scale with the positive lead on on the signal side of the sensor either after the sensor or at the PCM/ECM harness connector, and the negative lead to a known good ground. The duty cycle will only be displayed while the vehicle is in motion or the tires are spinning. If the duty cycle has any dropouts in voltage or the voltage is out of the manufacturers specifications, suspect excessive resistance in the TFT sensor, wiring harness or the OSS sensor itself. If an advanced scan tool is available, the OSS sensor signal can also be monitored while driving the vehicle. \nElectrical wiring - Check the wiring harness for any loose connections, loose wiring, or dirty terminals. Unplug each of the harness connections from the vehicle wiring harness, output shaft speed sensor, TFT sensor if equipped and the PCM/ECM. Using the the DVOM set to the ohms scale, with one lead on each end of the harness connectors using the factory wiring diagram as reference, check for excessive resistance. If resistance is very high, trace the wiring back through the circuit between each connector to determine the cause. If resistance indicates an over limit (OL) reading, look for any a broken or damaged wiring. Check for a short to ground in the wiring harness sections by moving either the positive or negative lead to a known good ground.\nThe volt meter should indicate an OL reading, if there is resistance present, there may be a short to ground and the wiring harness should be checked for pinched or damaged wiring, or areas that could be rubbed through touching the vehicle chassis. Check for a short to power by switching the DVOM to the volts scale, with the positive lead on the wire being checked and the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the run or on position. No voltage should be present, if there is voltage present there may be a short to power - check the wiring harness for any pinched or damaged wires that may have come in contact with eachother.\nTransmission fluid temp sensor - On vehicles equipped with a TFT sensor in-line with the OSS sensor, the TFT sensor can be checked for resistance by using the DVOM set to the ohms scale. With the transmission wiring harness connector disconnected, using the factory wiring diagram as reference to locate the appropriate wires to the TFT sensor at the transmission side of the connector and the positive and negative lead to either of the two wires, the DVOM should be reading resistance within factory specifications. If the reading is out of specifications or over limit (OL), replace the TFT sensor inside the transmission.\nCheck for a short to ground by moving either of the leads to a known good ground, the volt meter should be reading very high resistance or over limit (OL), if there is very little resistance found, suspect a short to ground, or a short inside the transmission internal wiring harness. Check the vehicle side of the transmission harness connector for power from the PCM/ECM using the factory wiring diagram as reference. Set the DVOM to volts scale with the positive lead on the power supply wire from the PCM/ECM and the negative lead on a good known ground, the voltage reading should be battery voltage or 5 volts reference voltage. If the voltage is ot of specifications, suspect a possible short to ground, faulty PCM/ECM, or a problem in the wiring between the transmission and the PCM/ECM. \n'"

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nGain access to a scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter, and a service manual (or All Data) for your vehicle. These tools will be necessary to diagnose a code P0724. \nBegin with a visual inspection of brake lamp wiring and a general inspection of underhood wiring. Test stop lamp system fuses and replace blown fuses as required. \nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Make a note of this information as it may serve you in further diagnosis. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if it immediately resets.\nIf it does: Check for battery voltage at the input circuit of the brake switch, using the DVOM. Some vehicles are equipped with multiple brake switches because, when the brake pedal is depressed, the stop lamps must be activated and the torque converter lockup must be deactivated. Consult your vehicle service manual to determine how your brake switch is configured. If there is battery voltage on the input circuit, depress the brake pedal and check for battery voltage on the output circuit. If there is no voltage on the output circuit, suspect a defective or misadjusted brake switch.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Check system fuses with the brake pedal depressed. Fuses that may appear operational at first test may fail when the circuit is under load \n Often a misadjusted brake switch may be misdiagnosed as defective \n To quick test TCC operation, bring the vehicle to highway speed (at normal operating temperature), lightly tap the brake pedal and hold it while maintaining speed. If the RPM level increases when the brake is depressed, the TCC is operational and the brake switch is deactivating it properly\n Major transmission damage can occur if the TCC system remains inoperable \n\n'"

","b'\nIn order to diagnose a P0725, I would need access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source.\nWhen diagnosing an automatic transmission related code (anything in the P0700s), I begin by testing the condition and level of the transmission fluid. Remove the dipstick (where applicable) and note the level of the fluid in the transmission. Also note the odor of the transmission fluid. If fluid smells burnt, appears extremely black, or has a heavy metallic hue, suspect that mechanical failure of the transmission has occurred. If the fluid level is more than one quart low, inspect the transmission, lines, and cooler for leaks and repair them as required. Fill the transmission according to manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and make sure that no more leaks are present. If a large transmission fluid leak from the torque converter area is exhibited, suspect catastrophic transmission failure that will require transmission removal and possible overhaul.\nOnce the transmission is full of the correct fluid and no more leaks are present, visually inspect wiring and connectors for signs of damage, corrosion, or overheating. \nWith the transmission filled to the recommended level with the appropriate fluid and no visibly damaged wiring or connectors present, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Write this information down because it may be helpful as your diagnosis progresses. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle if possible.\nIf the P0725 is reset, connect the scanner to the vehicle and observe the engine speed input signal (to the PCM) on the data display screen. If possible, test-drive the vehicle and note engine input speed. If engine input speed varies greatly from engine RPM, suspect a defective engine input speed sensor or reluctor ring damage/wear.\nI would use the DVOM to test the engine input speed sensor by finding the specifications in the vehicle information source and following testing recommendations. I would also check the sensors magnetic tip for excessive metal deposits and the reluctor ring for imperfections.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n If an oscilloscope is accessible, you can use it to observe live data from the sensor in question\nTo prevent damage, unplug electrical connectors from all related controllers before using the DVOM to check resistance and continuity of system circuits \n\n \n\n \n'"

While most OBD-II equipped vehicles have automatic transmission dipsticks/tubes, others do not. If the fluid level is not within specifications, inspect the transmission housing, lines, and cooler for leaks. After any leaks are repaired, refill the transmission according to manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specs and recheck to make sure that no more leaks are present. \nPay particular attention to the odor and condition of the transmission fluid. If the fluid smells excessively burnt, appears extremely black, or has a heavy metallic hue, it is safe to suspect that the transmission has incurred catastrophic mechanical failure. If this is the case, you may want to remove the transmission pan and check for excessive debris such as clutch material, metal, parts, etc. If the pan has excessive debris, removal of the transmission and an overhaul (with a new torque converter) will likely be required. With no more leaks present and the transmission full of the recommended fluid, you are ready to visually inspect wiring and connectors for signs of corrosion, overheating, or other damage. Make repairs as needed. \n Step 2 - Using the Scanner Effectively\nIf there are no visibly damaged wiring harnesses or connectors, and the transmission is filled to the correct level with the recommended fluid, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Writing this information down may prove helpful as the diagnosis moves forward. \nShould the P0728 be reset, reconnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port. Now, carefully monitor the data display screen while test driving the vehicle. Narrow the scanner data display to include only pertinent data and focus on engine input speed. If it fluctuates inexplicably or varies greatly from engine RPM, suspect a defective engine input speed sensor or a damaged/worn reluctor ring.\nStep 3 - Testing the Engine Speed Input Sensor\nAfter unplugging the electrical connector from the engine speed input sensor, consult your vehicle information source and follow testing recommendations (using the DVOM) to test the sensor. The engine input speed sensor is defective if it does not fall within specs. If it is within specs, go to the next step.\nStep 4 - Testing the Engine Speed Input Sensor Signal/Circuit\nReconnect the engine speed input sensor and test the sensor signal by connecting the test leads (of the DVOM) to the signal wire and the sensor ground wire right behind the sensor connector. Use your vehicle information source and follow manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications while carefully looking for glitches/spikes in sensor signal voltage with the engine running and the transmission in park or neutral. If the sensor signal is acceptable, use the DVOM to test system circuits between the sensor connector and the PCM connector (see note at the bottom of the page).\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n An oscilloscope can also be used for observing live data from the sensor in question\nUnplug electrical connectors from related controllers before using the DVOM to check resistance and continuity of system circuits \n\n \n\n \n'"

Getting access to a known fix can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nTools\nSome of the things you may need when diagnosing or repairing engine speed output circuits and systems:\n\nOBD code reader\nMultimeter\nBasic socket set\nBasic ratchet and wrench sets\nBasic screwdriver set\nBattery terminal cleaner\nService manual\n\nSafety Tips\n\n Let engine cool\nChalk wheels\nWear PPE (Personal protective equipment)\n\nNOTE: ALWAYS verify and record the integrity of your battery and charging system before further troubleshooting.\nBasic Step #1\nIf your car's engine cranks fine but does not start, it may indicate a problem within the ESS (Engine Speed Sensor) itself. Test the sensor using desired electrical values from the manufacturer. Repair or replace accordingly. Typically speaking, these sensors read the speed of the crankshaft so it would most likely be mounted somewhere on the engine block.\nBasic Step #2\nCheck your fluids. Make sure to check the automatic transmission fluid. Making sure it is clean and full. Top up as necessary. Low fluid can cause automatic transmissions to do funny things , so keep on it! Black or extremely dark transmission fluid , will need to be replaced to ensure proper transmission function. Not only can low and/or dirty transmission fluid cause this code to be activated, but may cause further damage to internal transmission components. Which is one of the most expensive repairs in the business so ensure good clean fluid is present.\nNOTE: Always use transmission fluid recommended by the specific manufacturer for your make and model. A mistake here, can potentially cost thousands. Do your research!\nBasic Step #3\nCheck the wiring. Given the location of the ESS, the wires are exposed to the elements and road debris. Inspect for any damage to the harness. There may be chafing occurring if the harness is routed close to the engine and other sharp components. Repair and damaged wiring.\nNOTE: Refer to your service manual to make sure you properly identify the desired wiring harness.\nBasic Step #4\nClean the sensor. It may be fairly simple to remove the ESS. In this case, remove sensor from the engine block. Inspect the sensor's pickup, after all, these are magnetic and are extremely susceptible to picking debris/shaving which can potentially alter the electrical readings. Reinstall sensor once cleaned and free of debris.\nBasic Step #5\nInspect the TCM (Transmission Control Module). I've seen these mounted directly to the transmission a lot of times. This means that this electrical module is exposed to some harsh conditions. All that being said, take a peek for any signs of corrosion, damage and/or any kind of defect.\n \n\n \n"""

","b'\nWiring harness - Check transmission wiring harness for damage or loose connections. Use a factory wiring diagram to locate the appropriate power source and all connection points between circuits. The transmission may be powered by a fuse or relay, and triggered by the TCM. Disconnect the transmission harness at the transmission connector, power source and TCM. Check for continuity inside the transmission internal wiring harness by locating the appropriate + and - pins for the torque converter clutch solenoid.\nUsing a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM), set to ohms scale, check for resistance in the circuit with the positive and negative leads on the appropriate pins. If resistance is extremely high or over limit (OL), suspect a fault with the internal harness or the TCC solenoid - removing the transmission oil pan may be necessary to further diagnose the TCC solenoid. \nTest the wiring between the TCM and the wiring harness connector at the transmission case using the DVOM set to ohms. Check for a possible short to ground by moving the negative lead on the DVOM to a known good ground, resistance should be very high or over limit (OL).\nTorque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid - Check the resistance in the TCC solenoid and internal transmission wiring at the transmission case after removing the transmission harness plug (if applicable, some makes/models use a TCM bolted directly to the transmission case).

The TCC solenoid is normally controlled by a duty cycle to engage a more comfortable torque converter cluch engagement.\nTo test if the TCM is actually sending the signal, a graphing multimeter set to duty cycle or a digital storage oscilloscope will be required as well. The positive lead is probed into the wiring harness plugged into the TCM and the negative lead to a known good ground. The duty cycle shold be the same as being commanded by the TCM in the advanced scan tool reading.

","b'\nFirst you need to gather some tools together or borrow some (a rare occurrence with mechanics as our tools are our livelihood and we don\'t like to lend out our tools):\n\nOn Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) scan tool - to pull the code; can be found at many parts stores, online, or many parts stores will pull the code for free\nMultimeter that has a resistance (or OHM) reading\nSelf powered test light/probe (a \nWire diagrams will be very helpful - you can get these in a Haynes manual or if your friendly with the dealer or your local mechanic, they may be able to run off a photocopy\n\n\n<br>\nTIP: Before addressing any transmission issue make sure the engine is running in tip top shape! Address any other sensor codes or lean/rich codes first. There are a lot of sensors that are networked together that determine transmission shift scheduling. If one is ""offline/faulty"" then the ECM/PCM/EMC may be throwing this code through the fault it sees at another sensor.<br>\n<br>\nTIP: Many times a simple fluid and filter change will take care of minor transmission issues. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to lose with a fluid and filter change. Notice I say change and not a fluid flush. A fluid flush on a high mileage transmission may cause further damage. Also, for a transmission that is slipping I recommend \n\nFirst verify the condition/concern. In most cases the TCC solenoid applies in overdrive when commanded by the PCM. Locking of the TCC helps with fuel economy and lowers transmission fluid temperature due to the fact the converter is locked (research TCC operation to get an in depth look as the theory and operation is difficult to explain without getting too technical. With that explanation one may have the deer in the headlights look).\nIn my case my vehicle stumbled and almost stalled stopping at a light. When verified we can begin diagnosis.\nDo an overall fluid condition and level check if all is OK. Also, does the transmission shift correctly? Is the engine running correctly? Most transmissions problems are misdiagnosed due to a poor running engine. Remember, the power flow starts at the engine and goes through the transmission then out to the drivetrain.\nNext, check the external transmission harness and connectors. Also check your fuses and make sure the transmission case is grounded to the body AND the battery.\nProceed with finding the appropriate wires that correspond to the torque converter clutch. In most cases, it will be two wires; one for a ground and one for power. Apply power and ground and listen for the solenoid to click.\nIf the solenoid does not click, proceed with checking continuity across the solenoid and continuity to and from the corresponding wires to and from the sensor. The solenoid should have a low ohm (.02 to .05) reading, this will vary with manufacturers so verify your reading with a factory service manual or equivalent. The wires should also have a low ohm reading. Also, make sure neither wire are shorted to ground or power.\nIf the wires check out and the solenoid clicks. There may be a PCM issue, but I advise one to pull the transmission pan and closely examine the TCC solenoid for debris. Any small amount of debris will cause the solenoid to ""short"" and trick the computer into thinking it is applied. Or, if it\xe2\x80\x99s metallic debris, it will attach itself to the solenoid and prevent it from disengaging. This was the problem in my case.\nAlso I would advise one to get the latest calibration for your vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 computer (PCM) from your dealer. Manufacturers are constantly releasing new and improved software. There may be a revised calibration to address this code. Especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s intermittent.\nFinally if all checks out OK and you go ahead and replace the PCM, remember it needs to be programmed to the vehicle. In many cases there is an antitheft device in the key and with that the keys need to be programmed. Think dealer or mechanic.\nIf all else fails and your are at wits end, there may be an issue with the clutch assembly in the torque converter. This will most likely be evident if you feel a slip when the transmission goes into lockup in overdrive. Also the fluid may smell burnt or be totally black. Look into a rebuilt transmission or a replacement. \n\nGood luck! In my case, I am a Ford trained technician and due to experience I simply pulled the transmission pan and took a look at the solenoid and found my problem right off the bat. This is a common issue on higher mileage transmissions.\n'"

","b'\nYou will need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a transmission pressure gauge, and a vehicle service manual (or All Data DIY) to diagnose a code P0780.\nA careful visual inspection of the transmission and all related wiring harnesses is the best place to begin your diagnosis of this code. Pay particular attention to wiring that is routed near hot exhaust components and sharp edges. Keep in mind that a portion of the transmission control harness is located inside the transmission case. You may choose to wait and see if you must enter the transmission housing (for other purposes) to inspect this part of the harness. Interior transmission harnesses are prone to failure because of the harsh temperatures and sharp edges found inside of the automatic transmission.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve the stored codes. Write the codes down (along with any related freeze frame data) and then clear them from the PCM memory. \nSince this code may be caused by either an electronic or mechanical malfunction, you will also want to inspect the transmission, transmission cooler, and transmission cooling lines for signs of leakage. If the transmission is low on fluid, it will cause the transmission to slip, fail to shift properly, and experience delayed engagement. \nEither of these conditions may contribute to this code being stored. If the transmission is slipping and there is delayed engagement (with the fluid level normal), remove the dipstick (if applicable) and see if the fluid smells and looks burnt. If the fluid appears to be burnt, suspect mechanical transmission failure that will require a rebuild, with a new torque converter and cooler. \nIf the transmission fluid is significantly low (more than 2-quarts), you will need to locate the leak and repair it, Refill the transmission with the recommended fluid and test drive the vehicle to see if the problem persists and the code is reset. If the code is reset, use the transmission pressure gauge to check pump pressure. If the pump has been operated without enough fluid, it could have been damaged creating a low pressure condition that will also require a transmission overhaul. \nIf symptoms are limited to failed shift function, suspect a defective wiring harness or shift solenoid. Follow manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations for testing transmission control wiring and shift solenoids.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Some models will require that all shift solenoids be replaced at once. If this applies to your vehicle, don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to pinpoint which shift solenoid is faulty, just replace the solenoid bundle \n Often times transmissions are rebuilt when an electrical malfunction is the cause of a P0780 being stored\n\n \n\n \n'"

This step can save you time and money during diagnosis and repair!\nBasic Step #1\nFirst thing i would do here is check the ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid). If the fluid is dirty, smells burnt, overfilled and/or abnormal color it may be time to change your fluid. If you've owned your vehicle for 30,000 to 60,000 miles (50,000 to 100,000 kilometers) and don't remember ever changing your fluid or have any records of it, not only may this be your problem, but it may of been avoided by simply following your maintenance schedule. Just food for thought! Old fluid is dirty fluid, dirty fluid can cause blockages and blockages can cause this code so change your fluid!\nNOTE: Follow manufacturers recommended steps when checking ATF. This simple step can vary a meaningful amount between makes and models.\nBasic Step #2\nFluid is good, code is still active and symptoms present? Depending on your specific model, the shift solenoid may be accessible externally. If this is the case, inspect the solenoid and its harness/connectors for any signs of damage. Repair/replace any issues as necessary. Its a good time to have a peak for any leaks as well!\nTECH TIP: If your shift solenoid is internal, I don't recommend you attempt to access it, work around it for now. Exhaust other avenues, internal transmission diagnosing and repairing should be left to a certified technician.\nNOTE: The TCM and harness' involved in this circuit may be subject to harsh road conditions so make sure everything is intact and the way it should be.\nBasic Step #3\nTest the shift timing solenoid. You may be able to test the solenoid itself multiple ways. One test may include a resistance test where you use a multimeter to measure the resistance between the pins in the solenoid to verify to a degree its electrical integrity. Another may include manually applying voltage to the solenoid to verify its mechanical operation. Either one should be specified in your manufacturers service manual/technical literature.\nBasic Step #4\nTest the circuit from the TCM. You may be able to verify the functionality of the sensor and its circuit by performing the same tests as above but from the pins at the TCM and/or ECM. This is a good trick to verify not only the integrity of the solenoid but the electrical integrity of the circuit as well.\n"""

","b""\nBasic Step #1\nDepending on what tools/references you have at your disposal, your start point may be different. That said, if your scanner has any monitoring capabilities (DATA STREAM), you may be able to monitor the values and/or operation of your normal/performance switch. If so, toggle the switch on and off to see if your scanner recognizes your inputs. There may be a lag here so a few seconds delay is always a good idea when monitoring switches. \nNot only that, but if you find the mode switch inoperative according to your scanner, you may be able to jump some pins at the mode switch's connector to rule out the circuit. If the circuit is ruled out in this manner, and the switch is still inoperative, I would move on to testing the switch itself. Obviously these are general guidelines but with an moderately able scan tool, troubleshooting CAN be pain-free if you know what you're looking for. Refer to service manual for specs/procedures.\nBasic Step #2\nTest the switch itself, if possible. Most times, these switches are just to signal to the appropriate module(s) (e.g. TCM, BCM (Body Control Module), ECM, etc.) so it can implement modified shift patterns. That said, the majority of these I've run into are on/off style. This means, that a simple continuity test with an ohm meter can determine the functionality of the sensor. Now, these sensors are sometime incorporated into the shift lever so make sure to research which connectors/pins you need to monitor with your multimeter.\nNOTE: As with any transmission fault, always ensure fluid levels and quality are adequate and well maintained.\n \n\n \n"""

Using a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM) set to the Ohms scale, check for resistance on the 5-6 solenoid power and ground sources to determine if there is an open circuit or excessive resistance in the 5-6 solenoid. Visually inspect for for any pinched, disconnected or loose wires on the harness connectors.\nShort to power: Disconnect battery positive cable and wiring harness connector at transmission and check for continuity using the DVOM between power source and solenoid circuit wiring in key on / engine off (KOEO) position as well as the key off position.\nShort to ground: Disconnect battery positive cable and wiring harness connector at transmission and check for continuity using the DVOM between 5-6 solenoid power source and a known good ground.\nTCM or PCM failure: Using an advanced scan tool capable of controlling solenoids, manually activate the 5-6 shift solenoid. It may be necessary to manually activate transmission control relay on some vehicles if power is not present at the transmission wiring harness connector.

If so, begin your diagnosis with the power related fault code first, or with the multiple code diagnosis first, as this may be the reason for the P0840. \nNext, locate the Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch (TFPS) on your particular vehicle. The TFPS is usually found attached to the side of the valve body inside the transmission, although sometimes it may be found screwed into the side of the transmission case/body itself. Once located, visually inspect the connector and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion, especially if they are attached outside the transmission case. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P0840 code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nThis is the most common area of concern for this code, as the external transmission connections have the greatest number of issues with corrosion.\nIf the P0840 code does return, we will need to test the TFPS sensor and its associated circuits. With the Key Off, disconnect the electrical connector at the TFPS sensor. Connect a Digital Voltmeter (DVOM) black lead to the ground or low reference terminal at the TFPS sensor wiring harness connector. Connect the red lead of the Digital Voltmeter to the signal terminal at the TFPS sensor wiring harness connector. Turn Key On Engine Off. Check manufacturer's specifications; voltmeter should read either 12 volts or 5 volts. Wiggle the connections to see if they change. If the voltage is incorrect, repair the power or ground wire, or replace the PCM/TCM. \nIf the prior test passed, connect one lead of an ohmmeter to the signal terminal at the TFPS sensor and the other lead to the ground or low reference terminal at the sensor. Check manufacturers specifications on the resistance of the sensor to accurately test the resistance to pressure when there is no pressure applied to it. Wiggle the connector at the Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch while monitoring the resistance. If the ohmmeter readings do not pass, replace the TFPS. \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0840, this would most likely indicate a failed TFPS sensor, although a failed PCM/TCM could not be ruled out, nor could internal transmission malfunctions until the TFPS sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCM/TCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n"""

If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nThis is the most common area of concern for this code, as the external transmission connections have the greatest number of issues with corrosion.\nIf the P0879 code does return, we will need to test the TFPS sensor and its associated circuits. With the Key Off, disconnect the electrical connector at the TFPS sensor. Connect a Digital Voltmeter (DVOM) black lead to the ground or low reference terminal at the TFPS sensor wiring harness connector. Connect the red lead of the Digital Voltmeter to the signal terminal at the TFPS sensor wiring harness connector. Turn Key On Engine Off. Check manufacturer's specifications; voltmeter should read either 12 volts or 5 volts. Wiggle the connections to see if they change. If the voltage is incorrect, repair the power or ground wire, or replace the PCM/TCM. \nIf the prior test passed, connect one lead of an ohmmeter to the signal terminal at the TFPS sensor and the other lead to the ground or low reference terminal at the sensor. Check manufacturers specifications on the resistance of the sensor to accurately test the resistance to pressure when there is no pressure applied to it. Wiggle the connector at the Transmission Fluid Pressure Sensor/Switch while monitoring the resistance. If the ohmmeter readings do not pass, replace the TFPS. \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0879, this would most likely indicate a failed TFPS sensor, although a failed PCM/TCM could not be ruled out, nor could internal transmission malfunctions until the TFPS sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCM/TCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n"""

Once located, visually inspect the connector and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion, especially if they are attached outside the transmission case.

If this is not possible, find some 91% rubbing alcohol and a light plastic bristle brush to clean them with (an inexpensive toothbrush will work here; just don\xe2\x80\x99t put it back in the bathroom when done!). Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the IMRC valve/sensor voltage signals to and from the PCM. Monitor IMRC sensor voltage on your scan tool. If a scan tool is not available, then test the signal coming from the IMRC sensor with a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM). With the sensor connected, the red voltmeter lead should be attached to the IMRC sensor signal wire and the black voltmeter lead connected to ground.

It too should be pretty close to battery volts as well. If not, then the IMRC valve/solenoid is suspected to be open/shorted at this time. \nIf all testing has passed so far yet you still have the same code, check your scan tool and see if it can open and close the IMRC valve. This may be called an \xe2\x80\x9cActuator Test\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cBi-Directional Test\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cFunctional Test\xe2\x80\x9d depending upon scan tool / vehicle manufacturer. If the scan tool has that capability, and the scan tool can operate the IMRC valves, then the problem is either resolved and a simple code clearing is all that\xe2\x80\x99s left or a new PCM would be called for. If the scan tool has the capability but is unable to move the valves, either a defective ground circuit between the valve and the PCM is indicated, or a defective PCM. \n\n'"

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nThe more common failure items (and most commonly misdiagnosed items) on these systems are: the IMRC vacuum solenoids, as carbon builds up inside the vent portion and does not allow them to vent properly if at all and the second is the IMRC plates sticking/binding due to carbon deposits around them.\nFirst, note if there are any other diagnostic fault codes. If any of them are intake/engine performance system related, diagnose them first. Misdiagnosis has been known to occur if a technician diagnoses this code before any intake/engine performance related system codes have been thoroughly diagnosed and dismissed. Insure there are no intake or exhaust leaks. An intake leak, or vacuum leak, makes the engine run lean. An exhaust leak gives the impression of a lean running engine by the air fuel ratio/oxygen (AFR/O2) sensor.\nThe next step in this process is to locate the bank 2 IMRC valve/sensor on your particular vehicle. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for rubbing, scraping, bare wires, worn spots or melted plastic connectors. Pull the connectors apart and carefully look at the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. Check to make sure they are not burnt or corroded. If in doubt, get some Electrical Contact cleaner at any parts store if cleaning of the terminals is needed. If not possible, get some rubbing alcohol and a small plastic bristle brush (worn out tooth brush) to clean them. Once cleaned, let them air dry. Pack the connector cavity with dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and reassemble\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the IMRC valve/sensor voltage signals to and from the PCM. Monitor IMRC sensor voltage on your scan tool. If a scan tool is not available, then test the signal coming from the IMRC sensor with a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM). With the sensor connected, the red voltmeter lead should be attached to the IMRC sensor signal wire and the black voltmeter lead connected to ground. Start the engine and monitor the IMRC sensor input. Snap the throttle. As engine RPM increases, the IMRC sensor signal should change. Check the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications, as there may be a chart informing you of what the voltage should be at a given RPM. \nIf it fails this test, you will need to verify that the IMRC valve will move and is not binding or sticking inside the intake manifold. Remove the IMRC sensor/actuator and grab hold of the pin or linkage that moves the plates/valves inside the intake manifold. Keep in mind that these may have a strong return spring attached to them, so there may be tension on them as you turn them. Check for any binding/looseness in the plates/valves as you turn them. If so, you will need to replace them, and this usually means you will need to replace the entire intake manifold. This task is better left to the professionals. \nIf the IMRC plates/valves turn with no binding or excessive looseness, this would indicate the need to replace the IMRC sensor/actuator and retest.\n\n'"

","b""\nFuel pump senders normally last the life of the fuel pump. So if you have this code present, do a visual inspection of the fuel tank and wiring harness. Look for damage to the tank indicating impact that may have damaged the fuel pump or sender. Look for missing ground strap or a rusty ground where the fuel tank is grounded to the frame. Check for damage to the wiring harness connector. Repair as needed. Find out what kind of system you have and verify that voltage to the fuel level sensor is present at the fuel pump wiring harness. If not, repair the open or short in the wiring.\nDoing a voltage drop test on the ground circuit can determine if there is a high resistance path in the ground circuit. You can perform this by using a voltmeter and connecting one lead to the battery ground post and the other to the fuel level sensor ground at the tank. Turn the key on (preferably the engine should be running). Ideally it should be 100 millivolts or less (.1 volts). Anything close to 1 volt indicates a current problem or a developing problem. Repair/clean the fuel level sensor ground as needed. It's not impossible that the instrument cluster has failed internally or on the printed circuit board (if applicable). These are very difficult for the layman to test. But if you have access to a wiring diagram you may be able to remove the cluster and see the damaged circuit if it's located on the printed circuit board, but otherwise you'll need a scan tool that will communicate with the instrument cluster.\nA simple way to test the fuel level circuit is to provide a good ground to the fuel level sensor at the fuel tank connector. With the key on the fuel gauge should go to one extreme or the other. Removing the ground path completely should cause the gauge to do the opposite. If the gauge responds, you know the wiring that supplies voltage and ground to the fuel level sensor is good and that the instrument cluster is likely okay. The likely suspect would be the fuel level sensor itself. The fuel tank may need removal to gain access to the fuel pump module in the tank. A PCM or BCM (Body control module) failure isn't impossible but highly unlikely. Don't suspect this first.\n"""

","b'\nA good starting point is always a technical service bulletin (TSB) search for your particular vehicle. The vehicle manufacturer may have a PCM flash/reprogram to cover this issue, and it pays to check on this before you find you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone down a long/wrong path.\nNext, locate the Fuel Level Sensor (FLS) on your particular vehicle. This sensor is usually found mounted in the fuel tank or possibly even in the top of the fuel tank / fuel pump module. Once located, visually inspect the connector and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P2069 code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nThis is the most common area of concern for this code, as the fuel tank connections have the greatest number of issues with corrosion.\nIf the P2069 code does return, we will need to test the FLS sensor and its associated circuits. With the Key Off, disconnect the electrical connector at the FLS sensor. Connect a Digital Voltmeter (DVOM) black lead to the ground or low reference terminal at the FLS sensor wiring harness connector. Connect the red lead of the Digital Voltmeter to the signal terminal at the FLS sensor wiring harness connector. Turn Key On Engine Off. Check manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications; voltmeter should read either 12 volts or 5 volts. Wiggle the connections to see if they change. If the voltage is incorrect, repair the power or ground wire, or replace the PCM. \nIf the prior test passed, connect one lead of an ohmmeter to the signal terminal at the FLS sensor and the other lead to the ground or low reference terminal at the sensor. The ohmmeter reading should not be zero ohms nor should it be infinite. Check manufacturers specifications on the resistance of the sensor to accurately test the resistance to fuel level (1/2 tank of fuel might read 80 ohms). Wiggle the connector at the Fuel Level Sensor while monitoring the resistance. If the ohmmeter readings do not pass, replace the FLS. \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P2069, this would most likely indicate a failed FLS sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the FLS sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

This actuator is usually found mounted to the front of the engine, on top of the engine, inside the wheel wells or against the bulkhead. Once located, visually inspect the connector and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P2100 code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nFor this particular code, this is the most common area of concern, as are the relays / connections to the relays, with an actuator failure a close second.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the actuator and the associated circuits. Typically, there are 2 wires at each Throttle Actuator. First, disconnect the harness going to the Throttle Actuator. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), connect one lead of the meter to one terminal of the actuator. Connect the remaining meter lead to the other actuator terminal. It should not be open or shorted. Verify the resistance specifications for your particular vehicle. If the actuator motor is either open or shorted (infinite resistance or no resistance/0 ohms), replace the Throttle Actuator. \nIf that test passes, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 12V to the Throttle Actuator power supply circuit (Red lead to the actuator power supply circuit, black lead to a good ground). With a scan tool that can activate the Throttle Actuator, turn on the Throttle Actuator. If there is no 12 volts to the actuator, repair the wiring from the PCM or relay to the actuator, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at the Throttle Actuator. Connect a test light to 12V battery positive (red terminal) and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to the Throttle Actuator circuit ground. Using the scan tool to actuate the Throttle Actuator, see if the test light comes on each time the scan tool actuates the actuator. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to the actuator to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P2100, this would most likely indicate a failed Throttle Actuator, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the Throttle Actuator had been replaced.

This actuator is usually found mounted to the front of the engine, on top of the engine, inside the wheel wells or against the bulkhead. Once located, visually inspect the connector and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector.

Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P2101 code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nFor this particular code, this is the most common area of concern, as are the relays / connections to the relays, with an actuator failure a close second.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the actuator and the associated circuits. Typically, there are 2 wires at each Throttle Actuator. First, disconnect the harness going to the Throttle Actuator. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), connect one lead of the meter to one terminal of the actuator. Connect the remaining meter lead to the other actuator terminal. It should not be open or shorted. Verify the resistance specifications for your particular vehicle. If the actuator motor is either open or shorted (infinite resistance or no resistance/0 ohms), replace the Throttle Actuator. \nIf that test passes, with a DVOM, check to make sure you have 12V to the Throttle Actuator power supply circuit (Red lead to the actuator power supply circuit, black lead to a good ground).

If there is no 12 volts to the actuator, repair the wiring from the PCM or relay to the actuator, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at the Throttle Actuator.

To retrieve live data with the DVOM, connect the positive test lead to the appropriate signal wire and the ground test lead to the ground circuit, then observe the DVOM display while operating the DBW. Look for spikes in voltage as the throttle is actuated slowly from the closed position to wide open throttle. Voltage usually ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle but consult your vehicle information source for exact specifications. If spikes or other irregularities are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective. An oscilloscope is also a great tool for testing sensor operation.\nIf the sensor is operating as designed, disconnect any related controllers and test individual circuits with the DVOM, System wiring diagrams and connector pin out charts can help you to establish which circuits to test and where to find them on the vehicle. Repair or replace system circuits as required.\nSuspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error only if all system sensors and circuits check out.\nSome manufacturers require that the throttle body, throttle actuator motor, and all throttle position sensors be replaced as a single unit\n \n\n \n'"

If the cover is distorted in any way, the gear will be compromised requiring total replacement of the throttle body. \n\nThe first thing to do is go online and get the TSBs (technical service bulletins) for you vehicle relating to the code. These TSBs result from customer complaints or recognized problems and the factory recommended repair procedure. \nCheck online or in a service manual for a possible relearn procedure to reset the computer. For example, on a Nissan, turn the ignition on and wait 3 seconds. Within the next 5 seconds depress and release the pedal 5 times. Wait 7 seconds, press, and hold the pedal for 10 seconds. When the check engine light begins to blink, release the pedal. Wait 10 seconds and depress the pedal again for 10 seconds and release. Turn the ignition off. \nIf additional codes such as P2136 were present, address these codes first since they are a component in the system, and may be the direct cause of the P2135 code.\nPull the electrical connector out of the throttle body. Inspect it closely for missing or bent female terminals. Look for corrosion. Clean any corrosion using a small pocket screwdriver. Place a small amount of electrical grease on the terminals and reconnect it. \n If the terminal connector has bent or missing pins you can pick up a new ""pigtail"" at most auto parts stores or from the dealer. \nInspect the top cover on the throttle body for cracks or warping. If any are present, call the dealer and ask if they sell just the top cover. If not, replace the throttle body. \nWith a voltmeter, probe the accelerator pedal sensor. It will have 5 volts for reference and next to it a varying signal. Turn the key on and slowly depress the pedal. The voltage should climb from .5 to 5.0 smoothly. Replace it if the voltage spikes or it has no voltage at the signal wire. \nLook online for wire terminal identification on the throttle body of your vehicle. Probe the throttle body connector for power to the throttle motor. Have a helper turn the key on and slightly depress the pedal. If no power is present, the computer is at fault. If there is power the throttle body is malfunctioning. \n\nFurther reading: \nOther throttle related DTCs: P0510, &amp; others.\n'"

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nNext, locate the EGR throttle control valve on your particular vehicle. This valve is found in between the intake manifold and the air filter, similar to a throttle body. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply dielectric silicone grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P2141 code does return, we will need to test the EGR throttle control valve and its associated circuits. Typically, there are either 3 or 4 wires at the EGR throttle control valve. Disconnect the harness going to the EGR throttle control valve. With a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM), test the EGR throttle control valve signal circuit (Red lead to the valve\xe2\x80\x99s signal circuit, black lead to a good ground). If there is no 5 volts to the valve, or if you see 12 volts at the valve, repair the wiring from the PCM to the valve, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, check to make sure you have a good ground at the EGR throttle control valve. Connect a test light to 12V battery positive (red terminal) and touch the other end of the test light to the ground circuit going to the EGR throttle control valve circuit ground. If the test light does not light up, this would indicate the problem circuit. If it does light up, wiggle the wiring harness going to the EGR throttle control valve to see if the test light flickers, indicating an intermittent connection.\nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P2141, this would most likely indicate a failed EGR throttle control valve, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the EGR throttle control valve had been replaced.\n'"

","b""\nThe first step in the troubleshooting process for any malfunction is to research the Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) for known issues with the specific vehicle.\nAdvanced diagnostic steps become very vehicle specific and may require the appropriate advanced equipment and knowledge to perform accurately. We include basic steps below but refer to a vehicle year/make/model/powertrain specific repair guide for specific steps for your vehicle.\nBasic Step #1\nFirst thing you will want to do is let your vehicle's engine cool down. Most times EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) systems are very hot by nature given that they are usually mounted directly to the exhaust system. That said, if you do not let the engine cool adequately, you can risk burning yourself. Like mentioned, EGR valves a lot of time are mounted directly on the exhaust. The vent solenoids, that control the EGR's venting, are mounted anywhere in the engine bay, most times on the firewall. Generally speaking, the vent solenoid is a vacuum controlled solenoid so there are potentially many rubber vacuum lines running from this to the EGR system. \nRemember how hot it gets here? These vacuum lines do not stand well to these temperatures so make sure to inspect these lines thoroughly while you are inspecting the surroundings. Any burnt or broken vacuum line should be replace or repaired. Lines are inexpensive so I always recommend overhauling all the lines with new, especially if you find one that is deteriorated, if one went bad in this way, chances are the others aren't far away.\nBasic Step #2\nMake sure to thoroughly verify the integrity of the harnesses involved. They do run along and around the exhaust so it would be a good idea to tie up any loose wires or harnesses out of the way. If you find a burnt harness and/or wire, solder connections and make sure to insulate accordingly. Inspect vent solenoid for cracks and/or water intrusion. Given the fact that these sensors are subject to the elements and are made out of plastic, for the most part, should make you aware of some of the possible faults. Also, ensure connectors are making an adequate electrical connection and that the tabs are intact and not broken.\nBasic Step #3\nIf accessible and convenient, you could remove EGR valve to check out its condition. These valves are subject to a meaningful amount of soot. Use carburetor cleaner and a toothbrush to remove soot from any stubborn areas.\n"""

Repair open or shorted circuits as required and clean excessive metallic debris from effected sensors. Check reluctor ring integrity when inspecting the sensor.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored trouble codes and available freeze-frame data.

You may narrow the data stream to display only pertinent fields to increase the speed and accuracy at which the desired data is delivered. Inconsistent or erratic readings from VSS or wheel speed sensors may lead you to wiring, electrical connector, or sensor problems by narrowing the general area of the system malfunction.\nAfter you have located the VSS circuit from which the low voltage input is being initiated, use the DVOM to perform a resistance test on the sensor in question. Consult your vehicle information source for the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation for testing the VSS and replace sensors that do not comply with specifications. \nUse the oscilloscope to retrieve live data from each individual VSS by probing the sensor signal wire and the sensor ground wire.

Voltage usually ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle but consult your vehicle information source for exact specifications. If spikes or other irregularities are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective. An oscilloscope is also a great tool for testing sensor operation.\nIf the sensor is operating as designed, disconnect any related controllers and test individual circuits with the DVOM, System wiring diagrams and connector pin out charts can help you to establish which circuits to test and where to find them on the vehicle. Repair or replace system circuits as required.\nSuspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error only if all system sensors and circuits check out.\nSome manufacturers require that the throttle body, throttle actuator motor, and all throttle position sensors be replaced as a single unit\n'"

","b""\nFirst, visually check the #2 ECT sensor for damage to wiring or connector and repair as necessary. Then, if you have access to a scanner, determine what the temperature of the engine is. (If you don't have access to a scan tool, using the dash temperature gauge may not be an effective way to determine coolant temperature. This is because the P2182 code is referring to the #2 ECT SENSOR, and the dash gauge is operated by, usually a one-wire SENDER. Basically a different sensor that the code doesn't refer to.)\n2. If the engine temperature is abnormally high, around 280 deg. F, that's abnormal. Unplug the sensor on the engine and see if the signal drops to, say, negative 50 deg. F. If it does, then it's a good bet the sensor is bad, internally shorted, causing a low resistance signal to be sent to the PCM. However if you want to be sure it's the sensor and not the wiring, there's a couple tests you can do. With the ECT sensor unplugged, check that you have 5 volts on the reference circuit with KOEO (Key on engine off). Also you can check the resistance of the sensor to ground using an Ohm meter. The resistance of a normal sensor to ground will vary a little depending on the vehicle, but basically, if the temp of the engine is around 200 deg. F., the resistance will be about 200 Ohms. If the temperature is about 0 def. F., the resistance will be over 10,000 Ohms. With this test you should be able to tell if the resistance of the sensor matches the temperature of the engine. If it's not accurate according to your engine's temperature, then you probably have a bad sensor.\n3. Now, if the temperature of the engine according to the scanner is around 280 deg. F. and unplugging the sensor doesn't cause the reading to drop to negative 50 deg. F, but it stays at the same high temperature reading, then you'll need to repair the short on the signal circuit(ground) to the PCM. It's shorted directly to ground somewhere.\n4. If your temperature reading of the engine according to the scanner is showing negative 50 deg. F or so, (and you don't live in the arctic!) unplug the sensor and check for a 5V reference present at the sensor.\n5. If there isn't, then check at the PCM connector for proper 5V reference. If it's present at the PCM connector, then repair the open or short on 5V reference from PCM. If there is no 5V reference present at the PCM connector, then you're done with your diagnosis and you may have a PCM fault. 6. If the 5V reference circuit is intact, then check the ground signal to the PCM using the previous ground resistance test. If the resistance isn't normal for the temperature of the engine, then ohm the resistance of the ground signal to the PCM by removing the ground signal wire from the PCM connector. The wire should have no resistance, unplugged from the PCM to the sensor. If it does, repair open in the signal to the PCM. If it doesn't have any resistance on the ground signal wire and the resistance test of the sensor is normal, then suspect a faulty PCM. \nRelated ECT sensor circuit codes: P2186\n"""
"P2183
","b""\nIf there are any other ECT sensor codes, diagnose them first.\nUsing a scan tool, check the ECT #1 &amp; #2 readings. On a cold engine, it should match the IAT reading or should be equal to ambient (outside) temperature reading. If it does match the IAT or ambient temp, check the freeze frame data on your scan tool (if equipped). The saved data should tell you what the ECT reading was when the fault occurred.\na) If the saved info indicates that the engine coolant reading was at the coldest extreme (around -30 deg.

If they appear okay, warm the engine up while monitoring the ECT for any intermittent jumps high or low. If there are replace the ECT.\nb) If the saved info indicates that the engine coolant reading was at the warmest extreme (around 250+ deg.F) then that's a good indication the ECT resistance was intermittently low.

"P2184
","b""\nSince this code is for an abnormally low signal to the PCM from the #2 ECT sensor, the PCM saw a excessively &quot;hot&quot; condition in the engine coolant. This could be due to faulty ECT sensor or wiring, but it could, conceivably, be caused by an overheated engine. So if your engine was overheated diagnose that first. Having said that here are the possible solutions:\nUsing a scan tool, with KOEO (Key on engine off) check the #2 ECT sensor reading on the display. On a cold engine the ECT reading should match the IAT (Intake Air Temperature) sensor reading. If it doesn't, replace the #2 ECT sensor.\n1. If the ECT reading is showing an excessively hot reading, for example more than 260 deg. F, then unplug the ECT sensor. This should cause the ECT reading to drop to the extreme cold reading (around -30 deg.F or so). If it does, replace the sensor, because it's internally shorted. If it doesn't change the reading, the check for a short to ground on the signal circuit of the ECT wiring. It could be that the two ECT wires are shorted to each other. Look for any chafing or melted wiring. Repair as necessary.\na. If you can't find any wiring problems and the ECT reading doesn't drop to the extreme coldest when unplugged, then, check for voltage coming out of the PCM on the signal wire's pin at the PCM connector. If there isn't any voltage, or it is low, then the PCM may be bad. NOTE: On some models it is possible for the 5 Volt reference signal to be temporarily shorted. This can happen if an engine sensor internally shorts the 5 Volt reference. Since the 5 Volt reference is a &quot;shared&quot; circuit on many models, this will cause it to be abnormally low. Usually, though this will be accompanied by several other sensor codes. If you suspect that may be the case, unplug each sensor until the 5 Volt reference reappears. The last sensor unplugged is the offending sensor. Replace and recheck the signal wire from the PCM connector\n2. If the scan tool ECT reading seems normal at this time then the problem may be intermittent. Use a &quot;wiggle&quot; test to manipulate the wiring harness and connectors while watching the ECT reading on the scan tool. Repair any wiring or connectors that are loose or corroded. You could check the Freeze frame data if your scan tool has that function. It will show the ECT reading when the failure occurred. If it shows the reading to be at the hottest extreme then replace the ECT sensor and see if the code reappears. \nRelated ECT sensor circuit codes: P2186\n \n\n \n"""

Now, clear the codes.\nNext, I would perform a visual inspection of #2 ECT sensor wiring and connectors. Repair or replace burnt or damaged wiring and/or connectors as required and retest the system. If the P2186 is not immediately reset, it may be intermittent. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters OBD-II readiness mode or the code is reset. If the P2186 is now reset, continue with your diagnosis.\nReconnect the scanner and bring up the appropriate data stream. Narrow the data stream so that only pertinent data is shown and data response will be much faster. Observe the #2 ECT sensor temperature and voltage while looking for glitches or inconsistencies. These will be seen by the PCM as intermittent ECT sensor circuit signals. If there are inconsistencies, inspect the ECT sensor connector for signs of corrosion. Check wiring that is routed near hot exhaust manifolds/headers (intermittent short to ground) and loose or broken connector pins at the ECT sensor. Repair or replace defective components as required.\nLow engine coolant may also contribute to a code P2186 being stored. With the engine cool, remove the high pressure cap and make sure that the engine is full of the recommended coolant. If the engine coolant level is down by more than several quarts, inspect the engine for a coolant leak. A cooling system pressure tester may be helpful for this. Repair leaks as necessary, refill the system with suitable coolant, and retest the system.\n If the #2 ECT sensor is observed (in the scanner data stream display) as being extremely low or high, suspect that it is defective. Using the DVOM, test ECT sensor resistance and compare your findings with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply.\nIf the #2 ECT sensor seems slightly low or high, use the infrared thermometer to obtain actual ECT. Compare the ECT sensor signal reflected in the data stream with actual ECT and discard the sensor if the two do not coincide.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Make sure that the engine is full of coolant, and the thermostat is operating properly, before attempting to diagnose a P2186 \n Other ECT sensor codes, as well as engine over temp codes, may accompany this type of code \n Diagnose and repair other ECT related codes prior to diagnosing the P2186\n\nRelated ECT sensor circuit codes: P2185\n'"

","b""\nYour strategy for locating this problem begins with a test drive and observation of any symptoms. The next step is to use a code scanner (available at any auto parts store) and pulling any additional codes.\nThe computer has set a code P2187 stating that the fuel mixture is lean at an idle. This is the main code, however, any component malfunctioning within this loop that has the potential to cause a lean mixture will also be set in code. \nIf the test drive doesn't produce any symptoms it is possible that it is not a real code. In other words, the fuel mixture is not lean and that the computer or oxygen sensor is responsible for setting the code.\nEvery vehicle has a minimum of two oxygen sensors -- one in front of the catalytic converter and one after the converter. These sensors signal the amount of free oxygen left in the exhaust after ignition, which determines the fuel ratio. The front sensor is primarily responsible for the mixture, the second sensor behind the exhaust is used for comparison to the front sensor to determine if the converter is working properly. \nIf a rough idle is present or one of the other symptoms, begin the process with the most likely cause first. Either unmetered air is entering the intake manifold or there is a lack of fuel pressure:\n\nCheck the fuel cap for cracks and sealing and function\nLift the hood and make sure the oil filler cap is tight\nIf additional codes were present begin with inspecting them first\nLook for air leaks starting at the mass airflow sensor.

","b""\nYour strategy for locating this problem begins with a test drive and observation of any symptoms. The next step is to use a code scanner (available at any auto parts store) and pulling any additional codes.\nThe computer has set a code P2189 stating that the fuel mixture is lean at an idle. This is the main code, however, any component malfunctioning within this loop that has the potential to cause a lean mixture will also be set in code. \nIf the test drive doesn't produce any symptoms it is possible that it is not a real code. In other words, the fuel mixture is not lean and that the computer or oxygen sensor is responsible for setting the code.\nEvery vehicle has a minimum of two oxygen sensors -- one in front of the catalytic converter and one after the converter. These sensors signal the amount of free oxygen left in the exhaust after ignition, which determines the fuel ratio. The front sensor is primarily responsible for the mixture, the second sensor behind the exhaust is used for comparison to the front sensor to determine if the converter is working properly. \nIf a rough idle is present or one of the other symptoms, begin the process with the most likely cause first. Either unmetered air is entering the intake manifold or there is a lack of fuel pressure:\n\nCheck the fuel cap for cracks and sealing and function\nLift the hood and make sure the oil filler cap is tight\nIf additional codes were present begin with inspecting them first\nLook for air leaks starting at the mass airflow sensor.

","b'\nFuel pressure - Fuel pressure can be checked by using a mechanical gauge attached to the fuel rail. If the fuel pressure is within factory specificaions, there may be a fault with the fuel pressure sensor giving false readings to the PCM/ECM. If a fuel pressure test port is unavailable, the fuel pressure can only be checked using an advanced scan tool or by splicing adapter fittings in between the fuel lines and fuel rail.\nFuel pump - Fuel pump output is determined by the PCM/ECM and may be controlled by an external fuel management computer. The fuel pump may be duty cycle controlled on vehicles with returnless fuel systems. An advanced scan tool may be required to check the output on these type of fuel systems. Test the fuel pump for sufficient power by locating the fuel pump wiring harness. Some vehicles may be inaccessible to easily test the fuel pump wiring connections. Check for battery voltage at the positive terminal of the fuel pump using a digital volt ohm meter set to the volts scale with the positive lead on the power wire and the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the on or run position. The fuel pump power wire may only be supplied voltage during engine cranking or vehicle running condition. Voltage displayed should be close to actual battery voltage.\nIf there is insufficient power, suspect the wiring to the fuel pump and trace it back to determine if there is any excessive resistance in the wiring, loose wires or loose/dirty connections. On return style fuel pumps, the ground can be checked using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on the ground wire and the other lead on a good known ground. Resistance should be very low. On returnless style fuel systems, the trigger wire can be checked using a graphing multimeter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle scale. Typically the duty cycle from the fuel pump computer will be double what the computer commanded duty cycle is commanded by the PCM/ECM. Using the graphing multimeter or oscilloscope, the positive lead will be tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a known good ground, it may be necessary to determine which wire is correct by using a factory wiring diagram. The actual duty cycle should be about double what the PCM/ECM is commanding, if the duty cycle displayed is half of the amount, the settings on the DVOM may need to be changed to accomodate the type of duty cycle being tested.\nFuel lines - Look for physical damage or kinked fuel lines that would cause a restriction in the fuel pump supply or return lines. It may be necessary to remove the fuel filter to determine if the fuel filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, it should flow freely in the direction of flow indicated by an arrow on the fuel filter. Some vehicles are not equipped with fuel filters, and the filter is located on the inlet to the fuel pump itself, it will be necessary to remove the fuel pump module to determine if there is a lot of debris in the tank or if the fuel filter has been crushed or pinched which could also restrict fuel supply to the pump.\nRegulator - On vehicles equipped with a return style fuel system, the regulator is usually located on the fuel rail itself. The fuel pressure regulator usually has a vacuum line that will mechanically restrict fuel depending on the amount of vacuum supplied by the engine. Check for damaged or loose vacuum hoses to the regulator. If the vacuum hose has fuel inside of it, the regulator may have an internal leak that would cause a pressure loss. Using a non-damaging clamp, the hose can be pinched off after the fuel pressure regulator - if the fuel pressure is higher with a restriction on the return side of the regulator, the regulator may be at fault. On returnless systems, the fuel pressure regulator may be located inside of the gas tank on the fuel pump module and it may be necessary to replace the fuel pump module as a complete assembly.\nFuel pressure sensor - Test the fuel pressure sensor by removing the connector and checking resistance across the terminals using the DVOM set to ohms scale with the positive and negative lead on either of the connectors. Resistance should be within factory specifications. Check for reference voltage to the fuel pressure sensor with a factory wiring diagram to determine which wire supplies power to the sensor using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive lead on the supply wire and the negative lead on a known good ground. Voltage should be around 5 volts, depending on the vehicle.\nIf voltage is not within specifications, trace the wiring back to determine if there is excessive resistance in the wire supplying power to the sensor. The signal wire can be checked using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive wire tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground with the vehicle on and running. The voltage displayed should match the factory specifications depending on the outside temperature and the internal temperature of the fuel inside the lines. The PCM/ECM converts the voltage to a temperature to determine actual fuel pressure. It may be necessary to check the voltage at the PCM/ECM harness connector as well to determine if there is a difference in voltage. If the voltage at the PCM/ECM is not the same as the voltage displayed at the fuel pressure sensor, there may be excessive resistance in the wiring.\nUnplug the PCM/ECM harness connector and the fuel pressure sensor connector to check for excessive resistance using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on each end of the harnesses. Resistance should be very low, any excessive resistance may be a fault with the wiring or there may be a short to power or ground present. Look for a short to power by removing the PCM/ECM wiring harness connection with the DVOM set to volts scale, with the positive lead on the pin for the fuel pressure signal and the negative lead on a known good ground. If the voltage is the same as reference or higher, there may be a short to power and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine if there is a short. Check for a short to ground by setting the DVOM to the ohms scale with either lead on the signal wire at the PCM/ECM harness connector and the other lead on a good known ground. If there is resistance present, there may be a short to ground and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine where there is a short to ground.\n \n\n \n'"

","b'\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a suitable fuel pressure gauge, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) will be necessary for diagnosing a code P2294. \n\nI normally start with a visual inspection of system wiring and connectors; focusing my attention on harnesses and connectors on top of the engine. The warmth associated with this area makes it popular with pests in cold climates. These pests can damage (gnaw) system wiring and connectors.\nConnecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieving the stored codes and freeze frame data would be my next task. I write this information down because it may be helpful as the diagnostic process continues. Now, I would clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle if possible.\nIf the code is immediately reset, check for voltage and ground at the fuel pressure regulator.

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nYou will need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a hand held vacuum pump (in some cases), and a vehicle service manual (or the equivalent) to diagnose a code P2413.\nI usually like to begin my diagnostic process with a visual inspection of system related wiring and connectors. Repair or replace shorted or open circuits as required.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored trouble codes and available freeze frame data. I like to write this information down because it can be a big help if this turns out to be an intermittent code. Now, clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if the P2413 is reset.\nKeep in mind that this type of code may require multiple drive cycles to reset. In order to establish that you have rectified a low EGR performance condition, you will need to allow the PCM to go through a self-test procedure and enter OBD-II readiness mode. If the PCM enters readiness mode without a code being reset, the system is performing as commanded. The vehicle is also prepared for federally mandated emissions testing when the PCM is in readiness mode.\nIf the code is reset, consult the vehicle service manual to determine with which type of EGR system your vehicle is equipped. \nTo test the vacuum diaphragm EGR valve:\nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic port and pull up the data stream. Narrowing the data stream to display only pertinent data will yield a faster response. Connect the hand held vacuum pump hose to the EGR vacuum port. Start the engine and allow it to idle with the transmission in park or neutral. While observing the pertinent data on the scanner display, slowly actuate the hand held vacuum pump. The engine should stall from excessive EGR activation at idle and the appropriate sensor/s should show the expected degree of variation.\nIf the engine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stall with the vacuum pump pulled down, suspect that you have either a defective EGR valve or clogged EGR passages. Clogged EGR passages are more common in high mileage vehicles. You can remove the EGR valve and start the engine. If the engine makes a loud sucking sound and stalls, the EGR valve is probably bad. If the engine shows no change without the EGR bolted on, you likely have clogged EGR passages. You can clear carbon from EGR passages relatively easily on most vehicles.\nLinear EGR valves will need to be actuated using the scanner but the test for EGR passages is the same. Consult the vehicle service manual and use the DVOM to test resistance levels in the EGR valve itself. If the valve proves to be within specifications, disconnect related controllers and test system circuits for resistance and continuity.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n EGR valve failure is much less common than clogged passages or defective EGR sensors \n Systems designed to deliver EGR gases to individual cylinders can contribute to ignition misfire codes if passages become clogged \n\n'"

","b'\nSpecial note for Dodge/Ram Cummins diesel owners: There is a technical service bulletin (TSB), number 18-001-07 that may apply to your 2006-older truck that will fix it. The fix for that bulletin is to reprogram the PCM. You may also see the ""check gauges"" warning lamp and have a P2502 and/or P2503 DTC along with this one.\nTest the batteries for charge. Use a voltmeter and place the probes on both terminals. A fully charged battery will display about 12.75 volts. If the batteries are lower than 12 volts charge the batteries before proceeding. It is pointless to check a discharged battery. \n<p align=""center"">Checking battery voltage using a digital voltmeter:<br>\n<img src=""/images/battery-check.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""420"" alt=""Check battery using voltmeter"" border=""1"">\nIn the case of dual batteries, if one battery is notably lower than the other battery, it is probably bad. To clarify, the low battery is not taking a charge at the same rate and probably has a bad cell or two. If the caps are removable take them off. Look at the water level in all cells. If one or more are lower than the adjacent cells the odds are the cells are bad. \nWith a hydrometer check all the cells. Good cells will have 12.60 specific gravity. If all cells are equal but low, a discharged battery is indicated. If one or more are lower than 12.60 the cells have shorted and the battery is bad. \nIf a hydrometer is not available, use a voltmeter across the terminals of the freshly charged batteries. Attempt to start the engine and make note of the voltage drop on both batteries. If the voltage drops below 10.5 volts, the battery is bad. In 32-degree temperatures the voltage should be no less than 9.5 volts. \nIf the battery (batteries) won\'t take a complete charge they are bad. If they are bad under any of the above circumstances replace them. But that\'s not the end of the story. Why are they discharged or bad is the next question to answer.\n\nCheck all cables on the batteries for looseness and corrosion. If the batteries took a charge there is either a drain or a bad cable. Check the battery terminals and follow the cable to its end. Make sure they are tight and the ground is secure and clean.\nLook for broken insulation with exposed and corroded wires. \nStart the engine and use the voltmeter to check the voltage at the battery terminals. If the voltage is less than 13.5 or more than 15 volts the regulator is bad in the alternator. Shut the engine down and replace the alternator. If the voltage was 13.5 or better and less than 15 volts proceed to the next check.\nCheck for parasitic drain. This test requires a test light and voltmeter. Remove the negative terminal on one of the batteries. Make sure to turn everything off including the glove box light. The doors must be closed and no circuits working. \nWait 15 minutes for all the systems to go to sleep. Place the voltmeter on amps and install one of the test light probes on the battery negative and the other wire on the red ammeter probe. \nInstall the black ammeter probe on a good ground. There should be less than 30-miliamps draw. If it is less stop here. If the draw is higher disconnect the electrical clutch fan 6-pin connector and see if the draw dropped, if it does replace the clutch fan. If not reconnect the connector and disconnect the opposing battery negative cable. \nRemove the red battery cable from the rear of the alternator. Recheck. If the drain drops, one of the diodes is leaking in the alternator. Replace the alternator. If not reconnect the alternator and the negative battery cable to the other battery. \nCheck the ECU connections assuming everything else is good yet the batteries are draining. To check the ECU look in the underhood fuse block and remove the fuse to the ECU and recheck. If the draw drops the ECU connectors or computer itself is bad. If no draw was observed replace the fuse. Remove the test light and volt/ammeter. \nSystematically remove one fuse at a time and check the fuse terminals with the ammeter. Any circuit with excessive draw is the defective circuit or component. \n\n'"

","b""\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nIn order to diagnose a stored code P2610, you will need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY).\nIf there are one or more CPS codes present, diagnose and repair those before attempting to diagnose a stored P2610.\nYou will be well served to connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connecter at this time. Retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data and write this information down; it may be helpful, especially if the P2610 proves to be an intermittent code. Now, clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if the P2610 is reset. If it is reset, reconnect the scanner and observe CPS and engine RPM data using the data stream display. Focus on CPS and RPM readings with the key on and the engine off (KOEO). If engine RPM readings indicate anything other than 0, suspect a defective CPS or shorted CPS wiring. If CPS and engine RPM data appears normal, continue with the diagnostic process.\nUse the DVOM to observe ignition coil primary voltage with the ignition in the off position. If ignition coil primary voltage remains above five-volts, suspect a wiring short (to voltage) in this system. If voltage is at 0, continue with your diagnosis. \nUtilizing your vehicle information source, determine the precise parameters used by the ECM/PCM to indicate that the engine has been shut off and an ignition cycle has ended. Once you have made this determination, use the DVOM to test all individual circuits for related components. To prevent ECM/PCM damage, disconnect all related controllers prior to testing circuit resistance with the DVOM. Repair or replace defective circuits as needed and retest the system. Keep in mind that no repair can be declared successful until the ECM/PCM enters readiness mode. To accomplish this, just clear the codes (after repairs are performed) and drive the vehicle as usual; if the PCM enters readiness mode, the repair was successful and if the code is reset, it was not.\nIf all system circuits are within specifications, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Failure to address a code P2610 could result in catalytic converter damage (among other things) \n Don't assume that the PCM is at fault, system wiring malfunctions are common\n Use your vehicle information source to match technical service bulletins and/or recalls to the code/s and symptoms in question\n\n"""

","b'\nThe first step in the troubleshooting process for any malfunction is to research the Technical Service Bulletins for known issues with the specific vehicle.\nAdvanced diagnostic steps become very vehicle specific and may require the appropriate advanced equipment and knowledge to perform accurately. We include basic steps below but refer to a vehicle year/make/model/powertrain specific repair guide for specific steps for your vehicle.\nBasic Step #1\nIt is imperative that you follow basic maintenance procedures accordingly at this point, as far as the transmission\'s health goes, start at the fluid. Your ATF (Automatic Transmission fluid) needs to be clean, free of debris and also, proper maintenance schedules have to be followed to avoid more faults like this in the future. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last transmission has been serviced (i.e. filter+fluid+gasket), it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to perform this before continuing. Who knows there may be a bit of debris in your oil that is trapped internally. It may only take a simple service, so make sure you are aware of the last A/T service you have done.\nNOTE: Ensure you are using the correct ATF for your specific make and model.\nBasic Step #2\nMost likely, when trying to find the connector/harness for this system, you will have to find a junction connector. There may be one ""master"" connector so make sure you are working with the correct one by referring to your manual. Make sure the connector itself is seated properly to ensure a good electrical connection. Where the connector is located on the A/T, it may be subject to vibrations that could cause connections to come loose or physically damage them. Not to mention, the possibility of ATF to saturate connectors and wires causing future or present issues.\nBasic Step #3\nIt is always wise to be aware of the overall condition of your vehicle. Given the fact that, like in this case, other systems can directly affect other systems. Uneven tires, worn out suspension parts, incorrect wheels, all of these can and will cause issues in this system sand possibly others as well, so even things out, and you may rid of this code.\nThis article is strictly for information purposes only and the technical data and service bulletins for your specific vehicle should always take precedence. \n'"

If resistance is extremely high or over limit (OL), suspect a fault with the internal harness or the TCC solenoid - removing the transmission oil pan may be necessary to further diagnose the TCC solenoid. \nTest the wiring between the TCM and the wiring harness connector at the transmission case using the DVOM set to ohms. Check for a possible short to ground by moving the negative lead on the DVOM to a known good ground, resistance should be very high or over limit (OL).\nTorque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid - Check the resistance in the TCC solenoid and internal transmission wiring at the transmission case after removing the transmission harness plug (if applicable, some makes/models use a TCM bolted directly to the transmission case). Some makes/models use a transmission wire harness with the TCC solenoid and internal harness as a single unit. The DVOM should be set to ohms scale with the positive lead and negative lead on the pins for the TCC power and control circuit. Resistance should be within manufacturers specifications, if it is very high or over limit (OL), remove the transmission oil pan to inspect the solenoid inside the transmission if possible. Check for voltage on the power side circuit of the TCC solenoid or at the wire harness connector at the TCM with the DVOM set to volts scale, positive lead at the wire being tested and the negative to a known good ground with the vehicles key on/engine off, battery voltage should be present.\nTransmission control module (TCM) - Since the torque converter clutch is only activated during certain driving conditions, it will be necessary to monitor the TCM with an advanced scan tool to determine if the TCM is commanding the TCC solenoid and what the actual feedback reading is at the TCM. The TCC solenoid is normally controlled by a duty cycle to engage a more comfortable torque converter cluch engagement.\nTo test if the TCM is actually sending the signal, a graphing multimeter set to duty cycle or a digital storage oscilloscope will be required as well. The positive lead is probed into the wiring harness plugged into the TCM and the negative lead to a known good ground. The duty cycle shold be the same as being commanded by the TCM in the advanced scan tool reading. If the cycle stays at 0% or 100% or is intermittent, re-check connections and if all wiring / solenoid is OK, the TCM may be at fault.\n'"

Check for continuity inside the transmission internal wiring harness by locating the appropriate + and - pins for the torque converter clutch solenoid.\nUsing a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM), set to ohms scale, check for resistance in the circuit with the positive and negative leads on the appropriate pins. If resistance is extremely high or over limit (OL), suspect a fault with the internal harness or the TCC solenoid - removing the transmission oil pan may be necessary to further diagnose the TCC solenoid. \nTest the wiring between the TCM and the wiring harness connector at the transmission case using the DVOM set to ohms. Check for a possible short to ground by moving the negative lead on the DVOM to a known good ground, resistance should be very high or over limit (OL).\nTorque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid - Check the resistance in the TCC solenoid and internal transmission wiring at the transmission case after removing the transmission harness plug (if applicable, some makes/models use a TCM bolted directly to the transmission case). Some makes/models use a transmission wire harness with the TCC solenoid and internal harness as a single unit. The DVOM should be set to ohms scale with the positive lead and negative lead on the pins for the TCC power and control circuit. Resistance should be within manufacturers specifications, if it is very high or over limit (OL), remove the transmission oil pan to inspect the solenoid inside the transmission if possible. Check for voltage on the power side circuit of the TCC solenoid or at the wire harness connector at the TCM with the DVOM set to volts scale, positive lead at the wire being tested and the negative to a known good ground with the vehicles key on/engine off, battery voltage should be present.\nTransmission control module (TCM) - Since the torque converter clutch is only activated during certain driving conditions, it will be necessary to monitor the TCM with an advanced scan tool to determine if the TCM is commanding the TCC solenoid and what the actual feedback reading is at the TCM. The TCC solenoid is normally controlled by a duty cycle to engage a more comfortable torque converter cluch engagement.\nTo test if the TCM is actually sending the signal, a graphing multimeter set to duty cycle or a digital storage oscilloscope will be required as well. The positive lead is probed into the wiring harness plugged into the TCM and the negative lead to a known good ground. The duty cycle shold be the same as being commanded by the TCM in the advanced scan tool reading. If the cycle stays at 0% or 100% or is intermittent, re-check connections and if all wiring / solenoid is OK, the TCM may be at fault.\n \n\n \n'"

","b""\nIt's been my experience over the years, that wiring harnesses rarely have a short or open within the harness. That is not to say it can't happen, however, unless the wires are disturbed for some reason, they are rarely the problem.\nThe majority or problems with automotive wiring harnesses are located in their connectors to the computer or the end user, such as a control module. If not the connector, the next suspect is the computer or module. \n\nRefer to the vehicle's service manual to locate the CAN bus harness and the modules that it operates and their location as well. \nInstall a scan tool and operate each module independently to find out which ones operate and which ones do not. The problem will be in the circuit with the inoperative module. \nDisconnect the inoperative module. Inspect the electrical connector for corrosion, bent pins or looseness. Using a voltmeter, turn the key on with the engine off and check the harness side of the connector for battery power. No power indicates a harness or connector problem. \nReference the service manual for the ground terminal. Connect the electrical connector and probe the ground terminal to confirm at definite ground. If no ground is indicated, locate the ground and repair it as necessary. \nUsing the scan tool, locate the signal wire in the Can bus circuit and probe the appropriate terminals to check the waveform conformity to that given in the service manual. If the signal is erratic, replace the module.\nDisconnect the CAN bus from the TIPM. Inspect the connector for corrosion, bent pins or looseness. On the top row of terminals, count from left to right and locate the number four and five terminals. Connect the scan tool to the these terminals and start the engine. \nMake a note of the waveform and refer the height and spacing to that shown in the service manual. If not in compliance, replace the TIPM. \nDisconnect the harness at the module and the TIPM. Use an ohmmeter and check continuity on all wire terminals. Check each terminal for a short to ground. \n\n"""

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis. There is a known General Motors bulletin # 08-07-30-021E that applies to many 2007-2010 GM vehicles (Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet, Hummer).\nFirst, see if you are able to access fault codes and if so, note if there are any other diagnostic fault codes. If any of them are module communication related, diagnose them first. Misdiagnosis has been known to occur if a technician diagnoses this code before any other module communication related system codes have been thoroughly diagnosed.\nNext, locate all bus communication connections on your particular vehicle. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for chafing, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or possibly green in color versus the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some Electrical Contact cleaner at any parts store if cleaning of the terminals is needed. If this is not possible, find some 91% rubbing alcohol and a light plastic bristle brush to clean them with. Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nIf your scan tool can now communicate, or if there were any module communication related fault codes, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf communication is not possible, or you were unable to clear the module communication related fault codes, the only thing left that can be done is to unplug one control module at a time and see if communication with the scan tool occurs or the codes clear. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at a given control module. Once disconnected, unplug the connector(s) at the control module, hook the battery cable back up and retest. If communication now occurs or the codes now clear, that module / connection is at fault. \nIf communication is not possible, or you were unable to clear the module communication related fault codes, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician.\n'"

","b'\nLook online for all the Technical Service Bulletins on your vehicle. Check the bulletins for any reference to U0100 and the suggested repair procedure. While online, check to see if any recalls were posted for this code and check your warranty period.\nDiagnosing and repairing this type of problem is difficult at best using the proper diagnostic equipment. If the problem turns out to be a failed ECM or PCM, very likely it will need programming before the vehicle will start. \nConsult the service manual for a comprehensive description of the additional code relating to the offending module and its location. Look at the wiring diagram and locate the CAN bus for this module and its location. \nThere are at least two CAN bus locations. Depending on the manufacturer, they could be located anywhere inside the car-under the carpet near the sill plate, under the seat,behind the kick panel, in front of the center console (requires console removal) or behind the passenger air bag. Access the CAN bus.\nThe location of the module is dependent on what it operates. Air bag modules will be inside the door panel or under the carpet toward the center of the vehicle. Body ride control modules are usually under the seat, in the console or trunk. There are 18 or more modules in all late model vehicles. Each CAN bus handles communication between the ECM and at least 9 modules\nConsult the service manual and locate the pins to the module in question. Disconnect the connector and test each wire for a short to ground. If a short is present, rather than replacing the entire harness, cut the shorted wire out of the circuit about one inch from either connector and run a wire of equivalent size as an overlay. \nDisconnect the module and check the appropriate wires for continuity. If there are no opens, replace the module. \nIf there were no additional codes the ECM is in question. Install a memory saver before disconnecting anything to retain the ECMs programming. Treat this diagnosis in the same manner. If the CAN bus is not faulty, the ECM will need to be replaced. In most cases the vehicle will need to be programmed for the key to be accepted and a program installed in the computer in order for it to run.\nIf the need arises, tow the vehicle to the dealer. The least expensive way to correct this type of problem is to locate an automotive shop with an older experienced ""Master ASE automotive technician"" with the appropriate diagnostic equipment. \nAn experienced Master Tech will usually have the ability to quickly isolate and repair the problem in less time for a more reasonable price. The reasoning is based on the fact that the dealer as well as independents charge by the hour. \n'"

If any of them are bus communication related, or battery / ignition related, diagnose them first. Misdiagnosis has been known to occur if you diagnose the U0101 code before any of the basic codes have been thoroughly diagnosed and dismissed.\nIf your scan tool can access fault codes and the only one you get from other modules is the U0101, try to talk to the TCM module. If you can access codes from the TCM module, then the U0101 code is either intermittent or a memory code. If unable to talk to the TCM module, then the U0101 code that the other modules are setting is active, and the problem is there now.\nThe most common failure is loss of power or ground.\nCheck all fuses that power up the TCM module on this vehicle. Check all grounds for the TCM module. Locate where the ground attaching points are on the vehicle and make sure that these connections are clean and tight. If you have to, take them off, get a small wire bristle brush and baking soda/water solution and clean each one, both the connector and where it connects.\nIf any repairs were made, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from all the modules that set the code in memory, and see if the U0101 code returns or if you are able to talk to the TCM module. If the code does not return or communication is re-established with the TCM module, then the fuses/connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code returns, locate the CAN bus communication connections on your particular vehicle, most importantly the TCM module connector, which is behind the instrument panel. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the TCM module. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply dielectric silicone grease where the terminals contact. \nBefore connecting the connectors back to the TCM module, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the TCM module. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the TCM module. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the TCM module still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the TCM module connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN \xe2\x80\x93 circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit. You should see approximately 2.4 volts and fluctuating slightly. \nIf all tests have passed and communication is still not possible, or you were unable to clear the U0101 fault code, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician, as this would indicate a failed TCM module. Most of these TCM modules must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n \n\n \n'"

Let dry and apply dielectric silicone grease where the terminals contact. \nBefore connecting the connectors back to the GSC module, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the GSC module. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the GSC module. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the GSC module still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the GSC module connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN \xe2\x80\x93 circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit. You should see approximately 2.4 volts and fluctuating slightly. \nIf all tests have passed and communication is still not possible, or you were unable to clear the U0103 fault code, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician, as this would indicate a failed GSC module.

Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nIf your scan tool can access fault codes and the only one you retrieve from other modules is the U0123, try to access the YRS module. If you can access codes from the YRS module, then the U0123 code is either intermittent or a memory code. If unable to access codes for the YRS module, then the U0123 code that the other modules are setting is active, and the problem is there now.\nThe most common failure is loss of power or ground.\nCheck all fuses that power up the YRS module on this vehicle. Check all grounds for the YRS module. Locate where the ground attaching points are on the vehicle and make sure that these connections are clean and tight. If you have to, take them off, get a small wire bristle brush and baking soda/water solution and clean each one, both the connector and where it connects.\nIf any repairs were made, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if the U0123 code returns or if you are able to communicate with the YRS module. If the code does not return or communication is re-established, then the fuses/connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code returns, locate the CAN C bus communication connections on your particular vehicle, most importantly the YRS module connector. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the YRS control module. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nBefore connecting the connectors back to the YRS module, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the YRS module. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the YRS module. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the YRS module still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the YRS module connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN \xe2\x80\x93 circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit. You should see approximately 2.4 volts and fluctuating slightly. Other manufacturers show CAN C- at approximately .5 volts and fluctuating Key On Engine Off. Check the specifications for your manufacturer. \nIf all tests have passed and communication is still not possible, or you were unable to clear the U0123 fault code, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician, as this would indicate a failed YRS module. Most of these YRS modules must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

Check all grounds for the RLCM module. Locate where the ground attaching points are on the vehicle and make sure that these connections are clean and tight. If you have to, take them off, get a small wire bristle brush and baking soda/water solution and clean each one, both the connector and where it connects.\nIf any repairs were made, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if the U0132 code returns or if you are able to communicate with the RLCM module. If the code does not return or communication is re-established, then the fuses/connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code returns, locate the CAN C bus communication connections on your particular vehicle, most importantly the RLCM module connector. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the RLCM control module. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nBefore connecting the connectors back to the RLCM module, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the RLCM module. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the RLCM module. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the RLCM module still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the RLCM module connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN \xe2\x80\x93 circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit. You should see approximately 2.4 volts and fluctuating slightly. Other manufacturers show CAN C- at approximately .5 volts and fluctuating Key On Engine Off. Check the specifications for your manufacturer. \nIf all tests have passed and communication is still not possible, or you were unable to clear the U0132 fault code, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician, as this would indicate a failed RLCM module. Most of these RLCM modules must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the ROSCM module. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors.

Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nFirst, note if there are any other diagnostic fault codes. If any of them are bus communication related or battery / ignition related, diagnose them first. Misdiagnosis has been known to occur if you diagnose the U0162 code before any of the basic codes have been thoroughly diagnosed and dismissed.\nIf your scan tool can access fault codes and the only one you get from other modules is the U0162, try to access to the navigation display module. If you can access codes from the NDM, then the U0162 code is either intermittent or a memory code. If unable to access the NDM, then the U0162 code that the other modules are setting is active, and the problem is there now.\nThe most common failure is loss of power or ground to the navigation display module.\nCheck all fuses that power up the NDM module on this vehicle. Check all grounds for the NDM. Locate where the ground attaching points are on the vehicle and make sure that these connections are clean and tight. If you have to, take them off, get a small wire bristle brush and baking soda/water solution and clean each one, both the connector and where it connects.\nIf any repairs were made, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if the U0162 code returns or if you are able to communicate with the NDM module. If the code does not return or communication is re-established, then the fuses/connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code returns, locate the CAN bus communication connections on your vehicle, most importantly the NDM connector, which is usually behind the dash, usually in the center of the vehicle, although in some vehicles it may be mounted in the trunk. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the NDM module. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. \nPull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply dielectric silicone grease where the terminals contact. \nBefore connecting the connectors back to the NDM, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the NDM. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the NDM. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the NDM still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the NDM connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits.

"U0194
","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nFirst, note if there are any other diagnostic fault codes. If any of them are bus communication related or battery / ignition related, diagnose them first. Misdiagnosis has been known to occur if you diagnose the U0194 code before any of the basic codes have been thoroughly diagnosed and dismissed.\nIf your scan tool can access fault codes and the only one you get from other modules is the U0194, try to access to the digital audio control module b (DACM-B). If you can access codes from the DACM-B, then the U0194 code is either intermittent or a memory code. If unable to access the DACM-B, then the U0194 code that the other modules are setting is active, and the problem is there now.\nThe most common failure is a circuit fault which causes the loss of power or ground to the digital audio control module b.\nCheck all fuses that power up the DACM-B module on this vehicle. Check all grounds for the DACM-B. Locate where the ground attaching points are on the vehicle and make sure that these connections are clean and tight. If you have to, take them off, get a small wire bristle brush and baking soda/water solution and clean each one, both the connector and where it connects.\nIf any repairs were made, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if the U0194 code returns or if you are able to communicate with the DACM-B module. If the code does not return or communication is re-established, then the fuses/connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code returns, locate the CAN bus communication connections on your vehicle, most importantly the DACM-B connector, which is usually located behind the dash, usually in the center of the vehicle. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the DACM-B module. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. \nPull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nBefore connecting the connectors back to the DACM-B, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the DACM-B. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the DACM-B. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the DACM-B still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the DACM-B connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN B+ (or MSCAN + circuit) and CAN B- (or MSCAN \xe2\x80\x93 circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN B+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 0.5 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN B- circuit.

If you must, take them off, get a small wire bristle brush and baking soda/water solution and clean each one, both the connector and where it connects.\nIf any repairs were made, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from all the modules that set the code in memory, and see if you can now communicate with the DCM-D module. If communication is re-established with the DCM-D, then the fuses/connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code returns or communication still cannot be established with the module, locate the CAN bus communication connections on your vehicle, most importantly the DCM-D connector, which is usually located behind the kick panel adjacent to the door in question. may also be mounted inside the door in question. Disconnect the negative battery cable before unplugging the connector at the DCM-D. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic.\nPull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nBefore connecting the connectors back to the DCM-D, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the DCM-D. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the DCM-D. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the DCM-D still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the DCM-D connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN - circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit.

See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nBefore connecting the connectors back to the SCM-C, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the SCM-C. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the SCM-C. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the SCM-C still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the SCM-C connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN - circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit.

Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nBefore connecting the connectors back to the DS-D, make these few voltage checks. You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the DS-D. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the DS-D. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the DS-D still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the DS-D connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN - circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit. You should see approximately 2.4 volts and fluctuating slightly. Other manufacturers show CAN C- at approximately .5 volts and fluctuating Key On Engine Off. Check the specifications for your manufacturer.\nIf all tests have passed and communication is still not possible, or you were unable to clear the U0218 fault code, the only thing left that can be done is to seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician, as this would indicate a failed DS-D.

You will need to have access to a digital volt-ohmmeter (DVOM). Verify that you have power and ground at the DWM-E. Gain access to a wiring diagram and determine where the main powers and grounds come into the DWM-E. Reconnect the battery before continuing, with the DWM-E still disconnected. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to each B+ (battery voltage) supply coming into the DWM-E connector and the black lead of your voltmeter to a good ground (if not sure, battery negative always works). You should see a reading of battery voltage. Verify that you have good grounds as well. Hook the red lead of your voltmeter to battery positive (B+) and the black lead to each ground circuit. Once again you should see battery voltage at each connection. If not, repair the power or ground circuit problem.\nNext, check the two communication circuits. Locate the CAN C+ (or HSCAN + circuit) and CAN C- (or HSCAN - circuit). With the black lead of your voltmeter connected to a good ground, connect the red lead to CAN C+. With the Key On, Engine Off, you should see about 2.6 volts and fluctuating slightly. Next, connect the red voltmeter lead to the CAN C- circuit.
