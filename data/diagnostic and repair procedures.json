Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nFactory turbocharger boost pressure usually ranges between nine and fourteen pounds but check manufacturer\u2019s specifications for your vehicle. Test boost pressure to make sure that it is sufficient. If boost pressure is low, internal turbocharger repair or turbocharger replacement may be necessary. Also check turbo hoses and exhaust components for leakage.\nThere are two basic designs of turbo boost control valves. In the first design, the valve is actuated using engine vacuum. An electronically controlled vacuum control valve provides vacuum to open the boost control valve, which is closed after vacuum is restricted. Typically, the vacuum control valve (or solenoid) is supplied with battery voltage and the PCM (or boost controller) provides a ground signal when applicable. In this type of system, engine vacuum must be checked prior to testing system electrical circuitry, components, and connectors. You may quick check the boost control valve using a hand-held vacuum pump. Simply apply vacuum directly to the valve and check operation.\nThe other turbo boost pressure control valve design utilizes an electronic valve. The valve receives a voltage signal from the PCM (or boost controller) when applicable. The voltage signal causes the valve to open and close proportionally as required to maintain optimum boost pressure. \n\nProfessional technicians report that the boost control valve is often condemned in error, when the boost pressure sensor is the defective part\n Using a digital volt/ohmmeter, test system circuit voltage and continuity to ensure that it is within manufacturer\u2019s specifications.

The desired position of the valve is one which will afford maximum engine performance and efficiency, while avoiding potentially harmful (to the engine) boost levels.\nWhen diagnosing a P0039 turbo/supercharger bypass valve control circuit range/performance code, I would likely begin with an inspection of all wiring and vacuum hoses related to the turbo/supercharger and boost control system.

In some circumstances this can save a lot of time in the long run by pointing you in the right direction.\n<h3>Basic Steps</h3>\n\n Examine the condition of the fuel cap\nExamine the condition of the fuel for contamination\nVisually inspect the circuit connections and wiring\nVisually inspect the condition of the fuel lines for obvious defects\nCheck electrical connections for security and corrosion\n\n<h3>Advanced Steps</h3>\nNote: The advanced steps become very vehicle specific and require the appropriate advanced equipment to perform accurately. These procedures require a digital multi meter and the specific technical references for the vehicle. Voltage requirements will very based of the specific year, model and engine in the vehicle.\n<h3>Circuit Checks</h3>\nWith the key in the off position and with the sensor and ECM connected check for power and ground referencing the appropriate technical data. Ground should always read 0 volts and power should be 5 volts or 12 volts based on the vehicle and the system configuration. The specific technical manual or online reference material for your vehicle will guide you through this process. If all of these readings are correct the associated component most likely requires replacement. Frequency checks are recommended in some troubleshooting procedures to specifically pinpoint the source of the malfunction.\nIf this process identifies the absence of a power source or ground, continuity testing may be required to check the integrity of the wiring. Continuity tests should always by performed with the power removed from the circuit and the normal readings should be 0 ohms of resistance unless otherwise specified by the technical data. Resistance or no continuity is an indication of faulty wiring that must be repaired or replaced.\nHopefully, the information in this article has been helpful to point you in the right direction to correct the problem with your fuel composition sensor circuit malfunction.

For this code, the easiest thing to do is take a fused jumper wire (that\u2019s a jumper wire with a fuse in line; it protects the circuit you are testing) and connect the SIG RTN wire to the FRP Signal input wire. With the scan tool hooked up, monitor the FRP Sensor volts. It should now read close to zero volts. If a scan tool is not available that has a data stream, then see if code <a href=\"/p0192\">P0192 FRP Sensor Circuit Low Input is now set. If either of these have occurred, then the wiring and PCM are good. The most likely problem is the sensor itself. \nIf all tests have passed so far, and you continue to get a P0193 code, this would most likely indicate a failed FRP sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the sensor had been replaced.\n\n"}
{"P0194\n": "\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis. \nAlso, with this particular code, make sure you have no fuel pump/fuel pressure related codes. If you have any other codes that point to a fuel pump related issue, diagnose that code first and disregard the P0194 code.\nNext, locate Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor on your particular vehicle. It may look similar to this one:\n\nOnce located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for chafing, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or possibly green in color versus the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. You can get some Electrical Contact cleaner at any parts store if cleaning of the terminals is needed. If this is not possible, find some 91% rubbing alcohol and a light plastic bristle brush to clean them with. Afterwards let them air dry, get some dielectric silicone compound (same stuff they use for light bulb sockets and spark plug wires) and put some where the terminals come into contact. \nNext, make sure that the vacuum hose that connects the sensor to the intake manifold is not leaking (if used). Visually inspect all vacuum hose connections at the fuel rail pressure sensor and intake manifold. Replace as needed. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the code does return, we will need to test the sensor against a mechanical gauge. First turn the key off, then hook up the fuel pressure gauge. Next connect the scan tool and monitor fuel pressure on the scan tool. Turn the key on and note the pressure on the gauge versus what the scan tool reads. The scan tool and the gauge should be within 5 psi of each other. \nIf all tests have passed so far, and you continue to get a P0194 code, the last thing to check is the connections at the PCM. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look corroded, burnt or possibly green in color versus the normal metal color you are probably used to seeing. Wiggle all connections at the sensor, the PCM, and any other associated connector to check for looseness to find the cause for the intermittent condition.\nIf all tests have passed and you still get a code P0194, this would most likely indicate a failed PCM. A hard reset (battery disconnect) would be recommended before any PCM replacement could be justified. A FRP Sensor may have to be replaced as well.\n\n"}
{"P0195\n": "\n\nBegin by visually inspecting the engine oil temperature sensor and the corresponding wiring. Look for loose connections, damaged wiring, etc. If damage is found, repair as necessary, clear the code and see if it returns.\nNext, check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) regarding the issue. If nothing is found, you will need to move forward to step by step diagnosis of the system.\nThe following is a generalized procedure, as testing for this code varies between vehicles. To accurately test the system, you'll want to refer to the manufacture\u2019s diagnostic flow chart. \n<h3> Check for proper cooling system operation</h3>\nCheck that the engine reaches and maintains a proper operating temperature. If the engine overheats or does not warm up as designed, there is a problem with the cooling system that should be addressed prior to any further testing. Cooling system DTCs being set along with an engine oil temperature sensor DTC, also indicate a potential problem with the cooling system.\n<h3> Do some preliminary circuit testing</h3>\nUse a scan tool to monitor the engine oil temperature sensor data parameter. Disconnect the EOT sensor; the scan tool value should drop to a very low value. Next, connect a jumper wire across the terminals. If the scan tool now displays a very high temperature, the connections are sound and the ECM can recognize the input. This means the problem is most like the sensor and not a circuit or PCM problem.\n<h3>Test the sensor</h3>\nDisconnect the engine oil temperature sensor connector. Next, measure the resistance between the two sensor terminals using a digital multimeter set to ohms. Start the engine and watch the meter value; the values should decrease smoothly as the engine warms up (check the engine temperature gauge on the dash to ensure the engine reaches operating temperature). If engine temperature increases but EOT resistance does not decrease, the sensor is faulty and should be replaced. Note: most manufactures have resistance/temperature charts in their service information to aid in the diagnostic process.\n<h3>Check the circuit</h3>\n\n Check the reference voltage side of the circuit: with the ignition on, use a digital multimeter set to volts to check for a 5-volt reference from the PCM at one of the two engine oil temperature sensor sensor terminals. If no reference signal is present, connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the reference voltage pin on the EOT and the reference voltage pin on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity. If everything is good up to this point, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the ground signal side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the engine oil temperature sensor and the ground terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.
