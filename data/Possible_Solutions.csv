Test boost pressure to make sure that it is sufficient. If boost pressure is low, internal turbocharger repair or turbocharger replacement may be necessary. Also check turbo hoses and exhaust components for leakage.\nThere are two basic designs of turbo boost control valves. In the first design, the valve is actuated using engine vacuum. An electronically controlled vacuum control valve provides vacuum to open the boost control valve, which is closed after vacuum is restricted. Typically, the vacuum control valve (or solenoid) is supplied with battery voltage and the PCM (or boost controller) provides a ground signal when applicable. In this type of system, engine vacuum must be checked prior to testing system electrical circuitry, components, and connectors. You may quick check the boost control valve using a hand-held vacuum pump. Simply apply vacuum directly to the valve and check operation.\nThe other turbo boost pressure control valve design utilizes an electronic valve. The valve receives a voltage signal from the PCM (or boost controller) when applicable. The voltage signal causes the valve to open and close proportionally as required to maintain optimum boost pressure. \n\nProfessional technicians report that the boost control valve is often condemned in error, when the boost pressure sensor is the defective part\n Using a digital volt/ohmmeter, test system circuit voltage and continuity to ensure that it is within manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications.

","b""\nLike an auto technician, start with the most common problems. You will need a volt/ohmmeter, wire-piercing probe for the meter, a can of carburetor cleaner and a can of intake cleaner. Repair any problems as they are found and start the vehicle to determine if the problem is corrected -- if not continue the procedures. \nWith the engine off, open the hood and check the air cleaner element. \nLook for any loose clamps or leaks in the piping from the mass airflow sensor to the throttle body. \nInspect all the vacuum lines on the intake manifold for obstructions, cracks or looseness which could cause loss of vacuum. \nDisconnect each of the sensors and check the connector for corrosion and pushed out or bent pins. \nStart the engine and use the carburetor cleaner to find any leaks in the intake manifold. A short shot of carburetor cleaner over a leak will change the engine rpm noticeably. Hold the can at arms length to keep the spray from contacting your eyes lest you learn the lesson much like picking up a cat by the tail. You won't forget next time. Spray all connection points on the manifold for leaks. \nTake the clamp loose on the pipe connecting the mass airflow to the throttle body. Look in the throttle body to see if it's coated with coke -- a black greasy looking substance. If it is, pinch the tube from the intake cleaner bottle between the pipe and the throttle body. Push the pipe on the throttle body and start the engine. Begin the spray until the can is gone. Remove it and reconnect the pipe to the throttle body. \nTest the mass airflow sensor. Pull the connector off the sensor. Turn the ignition on with the engine off. There are three wires, 12 volt power, sensor ground and signal (usually yellow.) use the red voltmeter lead to probe the connector for 12 volts. Keep the black lead on ground. No voltage is a ignition or wiring problem. Install the connector and check the sensor ground. It must be under 100 mv. If the sensor has 12 volts and out of range on the ground, replace the sensor. This is a basic test. If it passes yet when finished with all tests and the problem still persists, the mass airflow may still be bad. Have it checked on a graphing computer such as the Tech II. \nCheck the operation of the throttle position sensor. Make sure it is seated properly and the bolts are tight. It is a three-wire connector -- dark blue for the signal, grey for the 5 volt reference voltage and a black or orange for the PCM negative wire.\n- Connect the voltmeter red lead to the blue signal wire and the black voltmeter lead to a ground. Turn the key on with the engine off. If the sensor is good it will have less than 1 volt with the throttle closed. As the throttle is advanced the voltage will rise smoothly to approximately 4 volts with no drop outs or glitches. \nCheck the MAP sensor. Turn the key on and backprobe the power reference wire with the red voltmeter lead and the black to ground. With the key on and engine off it must have 4.5 to 5 volts. Start the engine. It must have 0.5 to 1.5 volts depending on altitude and temperature. Raise the engine rpm. The voltage must react to the throttle opening by dropping and rising again. If not replace it. \n"""

","b'\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nNext, locate the MAP sensor on your particular vehicle. This sensor is found around the intake manifold and the throttle body. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. Inspect the vacuum passage from the intake manifold to the MAP sensor. Insure that it is free from debris and full manifold vacuum is getting to it (put your finger over the opening; should suck it closed!).\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0069 code does return, we will need to test the MAP sensor and its associated circuits. With Key On Engine Off, locate the MAP sensor PID on your scan tool if available. At sea level, it should read 0"" vacuum, approx. 100 kilopascals or 29.92 inches of mercury. These would all indicate atmospheric pressure KOEO. Once you start the engine, you should notice the readings change, depending upon the condition of the engine and upon how much you are pushing in on the throttle (around 20 inches of vacuum @ idle to 2-5 inches @ wide open throttle). \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0069, this would most likely indicate a failed MAP sensor, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the MAP sensor had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle in order to be installed correctly.\n'"

This sensor is usually found in front of the radiator behind the grille or front bumper area. Once located, visually inspect the connectors and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connectors apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connectors. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact.\nThe most common failure is connections, with a failed sensor a close second due to its adverse environment.\nWhile checking the connections you can test the sensor with a Digital Volt-Ohm Meter (DVOM). With the ignition switch off, disconnect the sensor and connect the Red (Positive) lead of the DVOM to one post on the sensor and the Black (Negative) lead of the DVOM to the other post. Determine the temperature of the sensor (what is the temperature outside) to the resistance on the chart. This is the resistance in ohms that your DVOM should be displaying. Either 0 ohms or infinite resistance (usually indicated by the letters OL) indicates a failed sensor.\nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if this code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0070 code does return, we will need to test the AAT sensor and its associated circuits. Typically, there are 2 wires at the AAT sensor. With the ignition switch off, disconnect the harness going to the AAT sensor. Turn the ignition switch on. With a scan tool accessing PCM data (provided that is the module receiving the AAT sensor input; the module receiving the AAT sensor input may be the Air Conditioning control module, Generic Electronic Module or some other module towards the front of the vehicle that can send the AAT sensor data over a bus network), read the AAT sensor temperature or voltage. It should read 5 volts or something other than ambient air temperature (very low temperature) in degrees. Next, turn the ignition switch off, connect a jumper wire across the two terminals inside the harness connector going to the AAT sensor, then turn the ignition switch on. It should read close to 0 volts or something other than ambient air temperature (very high temperature) in degrees. If there is no 5 volts to the sensor, or if you see no change, repair the wiring from the PCM to the sensor, or possibly a bad PCM. \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0070, this would most likely indicate a failed AAT sensor, although a failed control module could not be ruled out until the AAT sensor had been replaced.

Fuel pressure should also be tested under load with vehicle in gear or during acceleration. If fuel pressure is below spefications, visually inspect all fuel lines going back to the tank to see if there is a restriction such as a bent fuel line.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'obd_codes_com-banner-1','ezslot_0']));\nFuel filter may be clogged if it has not been changed for a long time, or the in-tank fuel screen may have become restricted or clogged - check for damage to the fuel tank that could cause the bottom of the tank to press up against the fuel pump inlet.\nFuel pump driver module equipped vehicles are usually operated on a PWM (Pulse width modulated) input signal from the PCM/ECM and a PWM output signal to the fuel pump, in other words they run on a duty cycle - which is a voltage on/off time rather than a constant voltage to regulate the pump speed. The PWM signal can be checked at the driver module using a wiring diagram for reference and a DVOM set to duty cycle with the positive lead on the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground. The duty cycle should vary according to fuel pump demand commanded by the PCM/ECM. Some vehicles such as Ford will double the duty cycle output, so a 30% input will result in a 60% output to the fuel pump. The duty cycle to the fuel pump should reflect this increase. This voltage is usually monitored by the PCM and may set an additional fault code if there is a problem with the fuel pump driver module.\nFuel pressure sensor can be checked using a wiring diagram for reference and DVOM.

","b'\nFuel pressure - Fuel pressure can be checked by using a mechanical gauge attached to the fuel rail. If the fuel pressure is within factory specificaions, there may be a fault with the fuel pressure sensor giving false readings to the PCM/ECM. If a fuel pressure test port is unavailable, the fuel pressure can only be checked using an advanced scan tool or by splicing adapter fittings in between the fuel lines and fuel rail.\nFuel pump - Fuel pump output is determined by the PCM/ECM and may be controlled by an external fuel management computer. The fuel pump may be duty cycle controlled on vehicles with returnless fuel systems. An advanced scan tool may be required to check the output on these type of fuel systems. Test the fuel pump for sufficient power by locating the fuel pump wiring harness. Some vehicles may be inaccessible to easily test the fuel pump wiring connections. Check for battery voltage at the positive terminal of the fuel pump using a digital volt ohm meter set to the volts scale with the positive lead on the power wire and the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the on or run position. The fuel pump power wire may only be supplied voltage during engine cranking or vehicle running condition. Voltage displayed should be close to actual battery voltage.\nIf there is insufficient power, suspect the wiring to the fuel pump and trace it back to determine if there is any excessive resistance in the wiring, loose wires or loose/dirty connections. On return style fuel pumps, the ground can be checked using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on the ground wire and the other lead on a good known ground. Resistance should be very low. On returnless style fuel systems, the trigger wire can be checked using a graphing multimeter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle scale. Typically the duty cycle from the fuel pump computer will be double what the computer commanded duty cycle is commanded by the PCM/ECM. Using the graphing multimeter or oscilloscope, the positive lead will be tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a known good ground, it may be necessary to determine which wire is correct by using a factory wiring diagram. The actual duty cycle should be about double what the PCM/ECM is commanding, if the duty cycle displayed is half of the amount, the settings on the DVOM may need to be changed to accomodate the type of duty cycle being tested.\nFuel lines - Look for physical damage or kinked fuel lines that would cause a restriction in the fuel pump supply or return lines. It may be necessary to remove the fuel filter to determine if the fuel filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, it should flow freely in the direction of flow indicated by an arrow on the fuel filter. Some vehicles are not equipped with fuel filters, and the filter is located on the inlet to the fuel pump itself, it will be necessary to remove the fuel pump module to determine if there is a lot of debris in the tank or if the fuel filter has been crushed or pinched which could also restrict fuel supply to the pump.\nRegulator - On vehicles equipped with a return style fuel system, the regulator is usually located on the fuel rail itself. The fuel pressure regulator usually has a vacuum line that will mechanically restrict fuel depending on the amount of vacuum supplied by the engine. Check for damaged or loose vacuum hoses to the regulator. If the vacuum hose has fuel inside of it, the regulator may have an internal leak that would cause a pressure loss. Using a non-damaging clamp, the hose can be pinched off after the fuel pressure regulator - if the fuel pressure is higher with a restriction on the return side of the regulator, the regulator may be at fault. On returnless systems, the fuel pressure regulator may be located inside of the gas tank on the fuel pump module and it may be necessary to replace the fuel pump module as a complete assembly.\nFuel pressure sensor - Test the fuel pressure sensor by removing the connector and checking resistance across the terminals using the DVOM set to ohms scale with the positive and negative lead on either of the connectors. Resistance should be within factory specifications. Check for reference voltage to the fuel pressure sensor with a factory wiring diagram to determine which wire supplies power to the sensor using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive lead on the supply wire and the negative lead on a known good ground. Voltage should be around 5 volts, depending on the vehicle.\nIf voltage is not within specifications, trace the wiring back to determine if there is excessive resistance in the wire supplying power to the sensor. The signal wire can be checked using the DVOM set to volts scale with the positive wire tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a good known ground with the vehicle on and running. The voltage displayed should match the factory specifications depending on the outside temperature and the internal temperature of the fuel inside the lines. The PCM/ECM converts the voltage to a temperature to determine actual fuel pressure. It may be necessary to check the voltage at the PCM/ECM harness connector as well to determine if there is a difference in voltage. If the voltage at the PCM/ECM is not the same as the voltage displayed at the fuel pressure sensor, there may be excessive resistance in the wiring.\nUnplug the PCM/ECM harness connector and the fuel pressure sensor connector to check for excessive resistance using the DVOM set to ohms scale with either lead on each end of the harnesses. Resistance should be very low, any excessive resistance may be a fault with the wiring or there may be a short to power or ground present. Look for a short to power by removing the PCM/ECM wiring harness connection with the DVOM set to volts scale, with the positive lead on the pin for the fuel pressure signal and the negative lead on a known good ground. If the voltage is the same as reference or higher, there may be a short to power and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine if there is a short. Check for a short to ground by setting the DVOM to the ohms scale with either lead on the signal wire at the PCM/ECM harness connector and the other lead on a good known ground. If there is resistance present, there may be a short to ground and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine where there is a short to ground.\nOther fuel pressure trouble codes include:\n\nP0087 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low\nP0088 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too High\nP0190 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit\nP0191 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance\nP0192 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Low Input\nP0193 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit High Input\nP0194 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\n'"

","b""\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen faced with diagnosing a code P0099, I like to have a suitable diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an infrared thermometer, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) at my disposal.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve the stored trouble codes and applicable freeze frame data. I normally write this information down in case I need it later. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle. If the code is immediately reset, proceed with the diagnostic process.\nMost professional technicians begin with a visual inspection of IAT sensor related wiring and connectors (don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the air filter and the air inlet pipe). Pay careful attention to the sensor connector as it is susceptible to corrosion because of its close proximity to the battery and coolant reservoir.\nIf the system wiring, connectors, and components appear to be in working order, proceed by connecting the scanner to the diagnostic connector and opening the data stream. By narrowing the data stream to include only pertinent data, you will get a faster response. Use the infrared thermometer to make sure that the IAT reading (on the scanner) correctly reflects actual intake air temperature.\nIf it is incorrect, consult your vehicle information source for IAT sensor testing recommendations. Use the DVOM to test the sensor and compare your findings with vehicle specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply. \nIf the sensor passes the resistance test, check for a sensor reference voltage and a ground. If either one of these are not present repair the open or shorted circuit and retest the system. If system reference and ground signals are present, obtain an IAT sensor voltage to temperature chart from your vehicle information source and use the DVOM to test sensor output voltage. Compare the voltage with the voltage to temperature chart and replace the sensor if actual findings vary from maximum recommended tolerances.\nIf actual IAT input voltage is within specifications, disconnect the electrical connector/s from all related controllers and use the DVOM to test resistance and continuity on all system circuits. Repair or replace circuits that prove to be open or shorted and retest the system.\nIf the IAT sensor and all system circuits are within recommended specifications, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nBy far, the most common cause of a P0099 being stored is a disconnected #2 IAT sensor connector. When the air filter is checked or replaced, the IAT sensor is often left disconnected. If your vehicle has recently been service, and a code P0099 is suddenly stored, suspect that the IAT sensor has simply been left unplugged.\neval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'obd_codes_com-leader-1','ezslot_1']));\nRelated IAT sensor and circuit trouble codes: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0110, P0111, P0112, P0113, P0114, P0127\n"""

If you are at a higher altitude, it should decrease about half a volt or so for each 1,000 ft. of altitude (this will vary from model to model) Or if you have a separate MAF (Mass air flow) sensor on your vehicle, they are usually equipped with a Barometric pressure reading. If so, the Baro reading should match the MAP reading (they both measure ambient air pressure). If they're roughly equal, then, check for Freeze Frame data of the MAP sensor (if available).\nNOTE: Freeze Frame data is the PCM recording a fault when it happens. It captures the readings of the various PIDS (parameter identifiers)available to troubleshoot what happened. It's like a recording of the problem as it happened. At idle a typical MAP sensor Voltage reading should be about a volt, and at WOT (wide open throttle) it should approach 4.5 to 5 Volts. As for the TPS, at idle, the voltage reading is about 1 Volt or less. As the throttle is opened the reading will increase to 4.5 Volts at WOT. Do the two readings make sense? For example, if the TPS reading on Freeze Frame data shows 2.5 Volts (indicating partial throttle) does the MAP sensor indicate a reading that isn't at either extreme? Using the Freeze Frame data (if available) compare the MAP reading to the TPS when the problem occurred. This can help you identify what happened\n If you have no access to Freeze Frame data then check if the MAP sensor voltage changes when you apply vacuum to it. You can do this by mouth or a vacuum pump. The voltage should increase as you apply vacuum. If the reading doesn't change as you apply vacuum, make sure there are no obstructions in the hose to the sensor. If the hose is clear, the MAP sensor is usually bad, but it doesn't rule out the following from causing the problem: Does the MAP sensor appear to be stuck at less than .5 Volts? Then:\nNOTE: This code shouldn't set if the MAP is stuck at extremely low voltage, however, I'm adding it in because there's no way to know for certain for which vehicles a low voltage condition may set a P0105.\n\nInspect the wiring harness and MAP sensor connector. Repair any damage\nUnplug the MAP sensor connector. Also, at the PCM connector, remove the MAP sensor signal wire and check for continuity to the MAP sensor connector. If there is infinite resistance, then repair open in MAP signal circuit.

(If you don't have access to a scan tool, using the dash temperature gauge may not be an effective way to determine coolant temperature. This is because the P0115 code is referring to the ECT SENSOR, and the dash gauge is operated by, usually a one-wire SENDER. Basically a different sensor that the code doesn't refer to.)\n2. If the engine temperature is abnormally high, around 280 deg. F, that's abnormal. Unplug the sensor on the engine and see if the signal drops to, say, negative 50 deg. F. If it does, then it's a good bet the sensor is bad, internally shorted, causing a low resistance signal to be sent to the PCM. However if you want to be sure it's the sensor and not the wiring, there's a couple tests you can do. With the ECT sensor unplugged, check that you have 5 volts on the reference circuit with KOEO (Key on engine off). Also you can check the resistance of the sensor to ground using an Ohm meter. The resistance of a normal sensor to ground will vary a little depending on the vehicle, but basically, if the temp of the engine is around 200 deg. F., the resistance will be about 200 Ohms. If the temperature is about 0 def. F., the resistance will be over 10,000 Ohms. With this test you should be able to tell if the resistance of the sensor matches the temperature of the engine. If it's not accurate according to your engine's temperature, then you probably have a bad sensor.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'obd_codes_com-large-leaderboard-2','ezslot_8']));\n3. Now, if the temperature of the engine according to the scanner is around 280 deg. F. and unplugging the sensor doesn't cause the reading to drop to negative 50 deg.

If your temperature reading of the engine according to the scanner is showing negative 50 deg. F or so, (and you don't live in the arctic!) unplug the sensor and check for a 5V reference present at the sensor.\n5. If there isn't, then check at the PCM connector for proper 5V reference. If it's present at the PCM connector, then repair the open or short on 5V reference from PCM. If there is no 5V reference present at the PCM connector, then you're done with your diagnosis and you may have a PCM fault. 6. If the 5V reference circuit is intact, then check the ground signal to the PCM using the previous ground resistance test. If the resistance isn't normal for the temperature of the engine, then ohm the resistance of the ground signal to the PCM by removing the ground signal wire from the PCM connector. The wire should have no resistance, unplugged from the PCM to the sensor. If it does, repair open in the signal to the PCM.

Having said that here are the possible solutions:\nUsing a scan tool, with KOEO (Key on engine off) check the ECT reading on the display.

If the ECT reading is showing an excessively hot reading, for example more than 260 deg. F, then unplug the ECT sensor. This should cause the ECT reading to drop to the extreme cold reading (around -30 deg.F or so). If it does, replace the sensor, because it\'s internally shorted. If it doesn\'t change the reading, the check for a short to ground on the signal circuit of the ECT wiring. It could be that the two ECT wires are shorted to each other. Look for any chafing or melted wiring. Repair as necessary.\na. If you can\'t find any wiring problems and the ECT reading doesn\'t drop to the extreme coldest when unplugged, then, check for voltage coming out of the PCM on the signal wire\'s pin at the PCM connector. If there isn\'t any voltage, or it is low, then the PCM may be bad. NOTE: On some models it is possible for the 5 Volt reference signal to be temperarily shorted. This can happen if an engine sensor internally shorts the 5 Volt reference. Since the 5 Volt reference is a ""shared"" circuit on many models, this will cause it to be abnormally low. Usually, though this will be accompanied by several other sensor codes. If you suspect that may be the case, unplug each sensor until the 5 Volt reference reappears. The last sensor unplugged is the offending sensor. Replace and recheck the signal wire from the PCM connector\n2. If the scan tool ECT reading seems normal at this time then the problem may be intermittent. Use a ""wiggle"" test to manipulate the wiring harness and connectors while watching the ECT reading on the scan tool. Repair any wiring or connectors that are loose or corroded.

I have also discovered that this type of BPS configurations will often require that an auxiliary ground be installed (depending upon manufacturer). \nContinue testing at the BPS if all circuits and connectors appear to be operational. Unplug the electrical connector and check resistance across all circuits of the BPS using the DVOM. If the sensor fails to comply with specifications, replace it.\nIf the BPS meets manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications, begin testing system circuits. To prevent damage, disconnect all related controllers before testing system circuits with the DVOM. Repair or replace open or shorted circuits as needed.\nSuspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error if the sensor and all circuits are compliant with manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specifications. Consider all other possibilities before replacement and remember that replacement of system controllers will require reprogramming.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nFor further diagnostic help, consult your vehicle information source for technical service bulletins that apply to the barometric pressure sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, or mass air flow sensor of your vehicle\neval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'obd_codes_com-leader-1','ezslot_1']));\n"""

","b""\nUsing a scan tool, determine if the Bank\n1, sensor 1 is switching properly. It should switch rapidly between rich\nand lean, evenly.\n1. If it does, the problem is likely intermittent and you should examine the\nwiring for any visible damage. Then perform a wiggle test by manipulating the\nconnector and wiring while watching the o2 sensor voltage. If it drops out,\nfix the appropriate part of the wiring harness where problem resides.\n2. If it doesn't switch properly, try to determine if the sensor is accurately\nreading the exhaust or not. Do this by removing the fuel pressure regulator\nvacuum supply briefly. The o2 sensor reading should go rich, reacting to the\nextra fuel added. Reinstall regulator supply. Then induce a lean condition by\nremoving a vacuum supply line from the intake manifold. The o2 sensor reading\nshould go lean, reacting to the enleaned exhaust. If the sensor operates properly,\nthen the sensor may be okay and the problem may be holes in the exhaust or an\nunmetered vacuum leak in the engine (NOTE: Unmetered vacuum leaks at the engine\nare almost always accompanied by lean codes. Refer to the appropriate articles\nfor diagnosing an unmetered vacuum leak). If the exhaust does have holes in\nit, it's possible that the o2 sensor may be misreading the exhaust because of\nthe extra oxygen entering the pipe via those holes\n3. If none of this is the case and the o2 sensor just isn't switching or acts\nsluggish, unplug the sensor and make sure there is 5 Volt reference voltage\nto the sensor. Then check for 12V supply to the o2 sensor's heater circuit.\nAlso check for continuity to ground on the ground circuit. If any of these are\nmissing, or aren't their proper voltage, repair open or short in the appropriate\nwire. The o2 sensor will not operate properly without proper voltage. If the\nproper voltages are present, replace the o2 sensor.\n \n\n \n"""
